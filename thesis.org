** Summary

In this thesis, we explore a /bottom-up/ approach to understand
spontaneous population dynamics and evoked responses in
neocortex. Starting from cellular and circuit properties (determined
experimentally), we build a model describing population activity at
the network level. Ultimately, we compare the model behavior with
experimental data to assess the explanatory power of the model. By
doing so we quantify whether, and how much, the emergent properties at
the macroscopic level result from the considered microscopic
interactions.

In particular, we focused on neocortical computation during the
asynchronous state of cortical networks

** Neocortical physiology

 We introduce here the biological system whose functional properties
 are investigated in this thesis: the mammalian *neocortex*. This part
 is not thought to be an extensive review of the current knowledge
 about this complex brain structure, we simply present the
 physiological concepts that will be used throughout the manuscript
 with an emphasis on the concepts develloped in the results of this
 thesis.

*** Generalities

 The neocortex is a brain structure appearing with the evolution of
 *mammals*. It is the structure where the most complex cerebral
 functions are performed (sensory perception, language, generation of
 motor commands, etc...). One can guess its functional importance in
 humans by realizing how energetically /expensive/ is this relatively
 tiny piece of tissue: while being only 2% of the body mass, it
 represents 25 % and 20% of the glucose and dioxygen consumption
 respectively.

 The neocortex, (Latin for /new bark/) is the superficial sheet, the
 top \sim 1mm in humans, of the *cerebral cortex*, the latter being
 the upper layer of the cerebral hemisphere (see Figure
 [[fig:neocortex-anatomy]]). The basic design of the neocortex is
 conserved across all mammals: 1) it is subdivided into functional
 areas called *cortical areas* having a precise cognitive function
 and 2) the cortical surface corresponds to the juxtaposition of
 *cortical columns* comprising about 10000-50000 neurons being each
 around 500 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wide. A notable difference between small
 mammals (e.g. rodents) and larger mammals (e.g. primates) is the
 presence of *folds* (/giry/ and /sulci/) of the neocortical sheet
 that allow an important increase of the neocortical surface given the
 limited skull size.

 Neocortical tissue is mainly composed of *neurons* as well as *glial
 cells*, the human brain contains about 100 billions neuronal cells
 and 500 billions glial cells. The *grey matter* is the part contaning
 the neuronal cell bodies und unmyelinated fibers, while the deeper
 *white matter* is composed of the myelinated fibers. Neuronal cells
 process information and transmit signals thanks to their
 electrophysiological and chemical properties. Neurons are highly
 interconnected via *synapses* forming recurrent and feedforward
 networks whose activation corresponds to cognitive processes. Glial
 cells (from Greek /glue/) are traditionally thought to: 1) surround
 neurons, hold them in place and insulate one neuron from another 2)
 supply nutrients and dioxygen to neuronal cells and 3) destroy
 pathogens and remove dead neurons. Though recent evidences suggest
 that glial processes might have a more direct role in neocortical
 function, this potential aspect of neocortical processing will be
 largely ignored within this thesis, we hypothetize that glial cells
 only participate to neocortical function by maintaining the
 /homeostasis/ in neuronal assemblies: insuring the stability of
 neuronal properties and synaptic transmission. We will therefore
 focus on the neuronal aspect of neocortical processes.

*** Laminar structure

A prominent feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization. It
can be divided into six layers according to different types of
neuronal cells and different connectivity properties (afferent,
recurrent and projecting connections). From pial surface to white
matter (see Figure [[fig:laminar-structure]]), we can distinguish:

- *Layer I*: the molecular layer. It consists mainly of extensions of
  apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal neurons and horizontally
  oriented axons, as well as glial cells. Those inputs onto apical
  tufts are thought to be important for /feedback/ control of local
  cortical computations. It also contains few neurons that, in the
  adult brain, seem to be only GABAergic interneurons.

- *Layer II*: the external granular layer. It contains small pyramidal
  neurons (the apical arbors are moderately develloped because of the
  proximity to the pial surface) and numerous stellate neurons. They
  receive input from the layer IV excitatory neurons and have a strong
  interlaminar recurrent connectivity within a cortical column.

- *Layer III*: the external pyramidal layer. It contains predominantly
  small and medium-size pyramidal neurons, as well as non-pyramidal
  excitatory and inhibitory neurons with vertically oriented
  intracortical axons. The intracolumnar circuitry of layer III
  pyramidal neurons is dominated by local intralaminar connections and
  the layer IV translaminar input. Recent evidence suggests that this
  is also true for at least a subpopulation of L III inhibitory cells,
  i.e. the fast-spiking basket cells (Xu and Callaway, 2009). The
  transcolumnar circuitry of L III pyramidal cells has been more
  difficult to study in the slice. Although structurally and
  functionally supragranular transcolumnar pathways have been
  described (Fox, 2002; Brecht et al., 2003; Broser et al., 2008),
  they are much less numerous in L III than in L II (Larsen and
  Callaway, 2006; Bruno et al., 2009)( own still unpublished
  results). This may be one reason for the so far lacking paired
  recordings of L III pyramidal neurons located in neighboring
  columns, in vitro and in vivo. Since the connection probability
  decreases monotonically with distance (Holmgren et al., 2003), new
  methods to pre-identify connected neurons (Wickersham et al., 2007)
  have to be further refined (Boldogkoi et al., 2009), in order to
  study the precise functional and morphological determinants of
  transcolumnar L III circuits (which is true for all other layers as
  well). Concerning the output of L III, consistently, L V(b) has been
  found to be the major intracolumnar target structure which
  represents one of the backbone feedforward projections of the
  “canonical microcircuitry” (Martin and Whitteridge, 1984; Thomson
  and Bannister, 2003; Kampa et al., 2006; Lefort et al.,
  2009). However, evidence has accumulated that also a functionally
  weak but anatomically consistent feedback projection to L IV
  excitatory neurons is formed (Martin and Whitteridge, 1984; Schubert
  et al., 2003; Larsen and Callaway, 2006; Lefort et al., 2009).

- *Layer IV*: the internal granular layer. It contains different types
  of stellate and pyramidal neurons, and is the main target of
  thalamocortical afferents as well as intra-hemispheric
  corticocortical afferents.

- *Layer V*: the internal pyramidal layer. It contains large pyramidal
  neurons which give rise to axons leaving the cortex and running down
  to subcortical structures (such as the basal ganglia). In the
  primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe, layer V contains Betz
  cells, whose axons travel through the internal capsule, the brain
  stem and the spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract, which is
  the main pathwayfor voluntary motor control.  

The cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there
exists characteristic connections between different layers and
neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These
cortical microcircuits are grouped into cortical columns and
minicolumns. It has been proposed that the minicolumns are the basic
functional units of the cortex. [9,sdkfjsdfjh] In 1957, Vernon
Mountcastle showed that the functional properties of the cortex change
abruptly between laterally adjacent points; however, they are
continuous in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Later works
have provided evidence of the presence of functionally distinct
cortical columns in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959),[10:skdhfsd]
auditory cortex, and associative cortex.  Cortical areas that lack a
layer IV are called agranular. Cortical areas that have only a
rudimentary layer IV are called dysgranular.[11;sdkshdf] Information
processing within each layer is determined by different temporal
dynamics with that in the layers II/III having a slow 2 Hz oscillation
while that in layer V having a fast 10–15 Hz one.[12]

*** Neurons in neocortex

As already suggested in the previous section, the neocortex is
characterized by a strong diversity in cellular types. Cells are
usually classified according to electrophysiological, morphological,
chemical and genetic markers. [[(check this on Markram interneurons
review)]]

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\linewidth
#+LABEL: fig:schematic-neuron
#+CAPTION: Description of a neocortical neuron, taken from [[url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron]]
[[file:./figures/schematic_neuron.png]]

Nonetheless, all neurons have some common features, see Figure
[[fig:schematic-neuron]]. A nerve cell contains a nucleus delimited by a
plasmid membrane. The cytoplasm contains organites common to all cells
(endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, Golgi apparatus, etc...). The
cell body, or *soma*, is the central part of the cell, its typical
diameter is around 20 \(\mu\mathrm{m}\). Nerve cells have two well
separated protrusions : the *dendrites* and the *axon*, receiving the
input and sending the output respectively. The dendritic arbor is a
ramified structure receiving contacts from other projecting neurons:
the *synapses*. When presynaptic neurons activate, a neurotransmitter
release happens at the synapse what opens selective ionic channels to
inject a current through the postsynaptic membrane. Those synaptic
currents sum along the dendritic arbor to reach the somatic and axon
hillock compartments. For high enough depolarizations, an *action
potential* is triggered and will propagate along the axon. The axonal
terminal also has ramifications and forms *presynaptic boutons*
([[check]]) onto other nerve cells, and will, in turn, induce
post-synaptic currents in those target cells when active.

We now describe differences between neocortical cells, the main cells
found in the neocortical sheet are shown on Figure [[cells-of
neocortex]]. A first distinction comes from the dichotomy between
*excitatory* and *inhibitory* neurons, indeed because of their
different neurotransmitter type (e.g. glutamate for the excitatory
cells or GABAa for the inhibitory cells), nerve cells can induce
either depolarizing currents or hyperpolarizing currents (promoting or
inhibiting the triggering of a spike). Neurons also differ in their
dendritic arborescence, their electrophysiological properties [[(see the
illustration of a Fast Spiking cell vs a Regular Spiking cell)]] as well
as their axonal projections.

*** Organizing principles of primary sensory systems

Though all sensory systems in mammalians (visual, auditory, olfactory
and somato-sensory) have their unique features, a common organizing
principle can be identified for the early pathway (at least to a first
order approximation): sensory transducer project to the thalamus, who
in turn projects to the primary sensory area.

** A theoretical framework to study asynchronous population dynamics in neocortex

The strategy explored in this thesis is a /bottom-up/ approach:
starting from cellular and circuit properties, we aim at building a
model describing population activity at the network level, and,
ultimately, compare the model predictions to experimental data. 

Thus, we need a theoretical framework that constructs a dynamical
system for the population activity given some cellular and circuit
properties. [[remove mean-field: building neural mass, then mean field
is just the auto-consistent solution]] The so-called /mean field/
approach provides such a procedure: it enables to derive models of
population activity in recurrent networks. The term /mean-field/
originally comes from an analogy with statistical physics: the
magnetization of a spin glass (the /mean/ magnetic /field/) that
results from the sum of the neighbour-to-neighbour spin
interactions. In this system, a self-consistency relation allows to
find the value of the macroscopic magnetization (in particular, the
bifurcation to a non-zero magnetization state). Such self-consistency
relations, now in terms of firing probability, have been used in
theoretical studies to describe the dynamics of recurrent neural
networks [[citep:Treves1993, Amit1997, Brunel1999, Hertz2004]]. The term
/mean-field/ now evolved to be equivalent /neural mass/, [[so useless
discussion of mean field]]

In this thesis, we will use a versatile framework for the description
of the population dynamics [[citep:ElBoustani2009]]. In this part, we
start by describing this framework, we illustrate its [[accuracy]] on the
dynamics of a numerical neural network and we discuss how this
framework can easily integrate more complex biophysical and circuit
properties.


*** A markovian description of asychronous irregular dynamics
<<sec:master-eq>>

We quickly expose the ideas presented in [[citet:ElBoustani2009]] and
derive the equations that describe the temporal evolution of the
temporal dynamics of a neural network.

We start by outlining the hypothesis of the description:

- 1) the network dynamics is *memoryless* beyond a certain time scale
  $T$. This is somehow the definition of the stochastic asynchronous
  state. In Figure [[fig:XX]] we show a typical autocorrelation time of
  the network dynamics, it is about 5ms. This hypothesis will allow a
  *Markovian description* of the system with a time step $T$.

- 2) each neuron is describe by its */stationary/ transfer function*
  $\mathcal{F}$, where \( \nu_\mathrm{out} = \mathcal{F}( \{
  \nu_\gamma\} ) \), i.e. the function that gives the stationary
  output firing rate \nu_{out} given a set of presynaptic rates
  {\nu_\gamma}, where \gamma indexes the different synapses.

- 3) the system allows a *continuous description* of time and firing
  rates. Markovian descriptions usually corresponds to discrete
  schemes
