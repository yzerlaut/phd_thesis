** Summary

The neocortex of awake animals displays an activated state in which
cortical activity manifests highly complex, seemingly noisy
behavior. At the level of single neurons the activity is characterized
by strong subthreshold fluctuations and irregular firing at low rate:
this constitutes the fluctuation-driven regime, which is believed to
be central to cortical computations. Sensory processing of natural
stimuli also evoke sparse response at low population
rates. Understanding the dynamical and computational properties of
this regime at the cellular and network level is a key challenge in
systems neuroscience. Because the reliable computation performed
during this regime happens on top of strong effects mediated by slow
population dynamics (such as variable levels of ongoing activity),
that in turn, determine the integrative and computational properties
at the cellular level, an accurate quantitative description of
population dynamics (and its correlate in terms of membrane potential
fluctuations) appears to be a necessary prerequisite to the
comprehension of this regime. This thesis devellops a modeling
framework to obtain theoretical descriptions of population activity in
cortical networks. The procedure relies on a /bottom-up/ approach: it
measures quantities at a microscopic scale (the cellular scale, \sim
10-100 \(\mu\mathrm{m}\)) to predict the behavior on a macroscopic
scale (from cortical columns to cortical areas, \sim 1-10 mm).

The nervous system is the part of an animal's body that controls the
body's functions (its voluntary and involuntary actions), it
coordinates and transmits signals to and from different parts of the
body (see the diagram in Figure [[fig:cns]]B).  The neocortex (Latin for
/new bark/) is the superficial sheet of the cerebral cortex, the
latter being the upper layer of the cerebral hemisphere (see Figure
[[fig:somato]]A), it appeared with the evolution of mammals and it is the
structure where the most complex cerebral functions (sensory
perception, language, generation of motor commands, etc...)  are
performed. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that render
those performances possible is a fundamental question in modern
biology.

The basic design of the neocortex is conserved across all mammals: 1)
it is subdivided into functional areas called cortical areas having a
precise cognitive function (see Figure [[fig:somato]]B) and 2) the
cortical surface corresponds to the juxtaposition of cortical columns
comprising about 10000-50000 neurons being each around 500
$\mu\mathrm{m}$ wide. A notable difference between small mammals
(e.g. rodents) and larger mammals (e.g. primates, see Figure
[[fig:somato]]B) is the presence of folds of the neocortical sheet that
allow an important increase of the neocortical surface given the
limited skull size.

 Neocortical tissue is mainly composed of neurons as well as glial
cells, the human brain contains about 100 billions neuronal cells and
500 billions glial cells. Neuronal cells process information and
transmit signals thanks to their electrophysiological and chemical
properties. Neurons are highly interconnected via synapses forming
recurrent and feedforward networks whose activation corresponds to
cognitive processes. Glial cells (from Greek /glue/) are traditionally
thought to: 1) surround neurons, hold them in place and insulate one
neuron from another 2) supply nutrients and dioxygen to neuronal cells
and 3) destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons. Though recent
evidences suggest that glial processes might have a more direct role
in neocortical function, this potential aspect of neocortical
processing will be largely ignored within this thesis, we hypothetize
that glial cells only participate to neocortical function by
maintaining the /homeostasis/ in neuronal assemblies: insuring the
stability of neuronal properties and synaptic transmission. We will
therefore focus on the neuronal aspect of neocortical processes.


A prominent feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization. It
can be divided into six layers according to different types of
neuronal cells (see Figure [[fig:diversity-laminar]]A) and different
connectivity properties (afferent, recurrent and projecting
connections). The functional role of this laminar organization is
still largely unresolved, but the layer specific connectivity scheme
(see Figure [[fig:diversity-laminar]]B) suggests that supra-granular
networks underlie cross-modality communication while infra-granular
networks might perform computations related to local cortical
features.

In *Work 1* and *Work 2*, we investigate how the biophysical and
morphological properties of layer V pyramidal neurons in mice visual
cortex shape their functional properties in a regime mimicking active
neocortical processing. In *Work 4*, we model a large-scale
excitatory-inhibitory Layer II-III network (\(\sim\)100mm^2) including
the horizontal fiber network that interconnects areas responding to
different sensory features.

*** Sensory processing as a model of neocortical computation

Cortical computation can be defined as the operations performed
between cortical representations (in a general sense, including brain
state, sensory stimuli, etc...). Sensory systems are of particular
interest as cortical representations encode information coming from
the physical world. The experimentalist can therefore manipulate those
physical quantity in a controlled fashion to establish relationships
between sensory stimuli and its neural representation. In particular,
in primary sensory areas, the relation with the physical world keeps a
relatively simple form. For example, the somatotopic map in the
primary somatosensory cortex, see Figure [[fig:somato]]C, reflects the
fact that neurons respond to a stimulus at a given location on the
skin, while higher order area along the somatosensory pathway would be
sensitive to more abstract features in the tactile stimulus.

Primary sensory areas therefore provide a good experimental system to
investigate the principles of cortical computation. This strategy
naturally implies the use of an appropriate recording technique to
image the neural representation, such as intracellular recording,
extracellular recordings, optical imaging, etc... In *Work 3*, we
investigate how the neural representation in the primary auditory
cortex of a simple auditory stimulus (a click of white noise) is
affected by the level of ongoing activity using intracellular
recordings /in vivo/. In *Work 4*, we investigate how two distinct
neural representations (encoding a single flash in two distinct visual
locations) interacts by using optical imaging /in vivo/.


*** Neocortical processing and population dynamics

Neuronal assemblies represent and process information through the
emission of stereotyped electrophysiological events: the actions
potentials. The information encoded by an assembly within a time
window is thus contained in its /raster activity/: the set of spike
trains across neurons. What are the quantities within this set that
are relevant for a /downstream/ readout ? This is still an open and
very controversial question. As an example, an influential theory
[[cite:Shadlen1994]], /rate-based/ coding states that the information is
carried by the temporal variation of the population firing rate
(defined over a short time bin). On the other-hand, the more general
/spike-based/ theory states that the temporal patterns of individual
spikes carry the information so that the population rate is a very
limited description of the neuronal asssembly. I will not review here
the arguments in favor of one view or the other, insightful reviews
can be found in the classical paper from [[citetext:Shadlen1994]] (in
favor of the /rate-based/ theory) or in [[citetext:Brette2015b]] (in favor
of the /spike-based/ theory). The purpose of this thesis is not to
take position in favor of one or the other theory (also given that a
definitive answer is unlikely to hold generally in the cortex in
general, e.g. olfactory system vs. visual system). Nonetheless, we
argue here that, whatever the /neural code/, an accurate description
of population dynamics in neocortical networks is a necessary
prerequisite to the understanding of cortical computation.

[[file:./figures/pop_dyn.png]]

First, let's define population dynamics. We define population dynamics
as the temporal variations of the instantaneous firing rate at the
population level. This definition is already problematic as an
instantaneous rate can not be defined, a firing rate has to be sampled
over a given time window. The question of the time-window thus becomes
critical, especially in the /rate/ vs. /temporal/ coding debate. We
take here a relatively conservative value:

 (after binning in a \(\sim\) 5ms time window) <=>
spiking probability in time. 

We give an example of how such a quantity can be determined using
extracellular recordings in Figure [[fig:pop-rate]]


In a /rate coding/ scheme, population dynamics constitute the /neural
code/, the increase of the firing of a given cortical sub-population
encodes a given sensory feature, the relevance of understanding
population dynamics is thus straightforward. In a /temporal coding/
scheme, the population activity is not sufficient, it is important to
have a sub-10ms precision in the spike timings and one should know
exactly which neurons are spiking.



We briefly review here some experimental evidences that support this
view.

In this thesis, 

*** Rationale behind a /bottom-up/ approach: models of high empirical content

At this stage, it is worth comparing the theoretical model resulting
from our /bottom-up/ approach to other models in the litterature.

Competing models for macroscopic population dynamics are
phenomenological models, the most prominent example being the model of
[[citetext:Rubin2013]] for primary visual cortex computation. We will
focus on this model within this discussion. This model has only two
variables: the excitatory and inhibitory population activities
(comparable to our two population model). It has also very few
parameters: the 3 parameters of their /power law/ input-output
function and the connectivity parameters. This very low number of
parameters might be seen  as a 

The number of parameters is obvisouly a lot larger (ionic channel
parameters, synaptic quantities, membrane quantities, morphology
parameters, circuit properties, ...)


We now examine this comparison in the light of an epistemological
consideration: the distinction between /empirical content/ and
/empirical accuracy/ (adapted from [[citetext:Brette2015a]], where it was
discussed for models of spike initiation). The empirical accuracy

*** Modulation of sensory responses by network state

We identified an important principle, the final effect for the
modulation result from the competition between:

- cellular gain modulation [[cite:Ho2000,Chance2002]]. This mechanism is
  in favor of the quiescent-state.

- recruitment within the network to amplify the stimulus through the
  recurrent connectivity. This mechanism is in favor of the active-state.


The potentiation of the Up-state increases as a function of the number
of networks when arranged in a feedforward manner.


Requires great care about what is actually measured. Somatic
intracellular do not predict the same effect as multi-unit
activity. The predictions of this model is that in terms of multi-unit
activity, the response should be systematically lower in the
Down-state than in the Up-state. A notable exception would appear for
very strong stimuli [[cite:Ho2000]] , but this would presumably result ina
pathological situation as this effect appears when all neurons respond
[[cite:Ho2000]].

Those ingredients are also present in our mopulation model of
neocortical integration(though a bit hidden by the strongest effect of
the assymetries in excitabilities). Is the variability found in
