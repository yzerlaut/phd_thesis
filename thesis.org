** Summary

The neocortex of awake animals displays an activated state in which
cortical activity manifests highly complex, seemingly noisy
behavior. At the level of single neurons the activity is characterized
by strong subthreshold fluctuations and irregular firing at low rate:
this constitutes the fluctuation-driven regime, which is believed to
be central to cortical computations.

The focus of this thesis is to understand how the biophysical
properties at the cellular level combined with the properties of the
network architecture shapes the dynamics of neural assemblies.


As a first step, we formulated a two steps procedure to derive the



Sensory processing of natural stimuli also evoke sparse response at
low population rates. Understanding the dynamical and computational
properties of this regime at the cellular and network level is a key
challenge in systems neuroscience. Because the reliable computation
performed during this regime happens on top of strong effects mediated
by slow population dynamics (such as variable levels of ongoing
activity), that in turn, determine the integrative and computational
properties at the cellular level, an accurate quantitative description
of population dynamics (and its correlate in terms of membrane
potential fluctuations) appears to be a necessary prerequisite to the
comprehension of this regime. This thesis devellops a modeling
framework to obtain theoretical descriptions of population activity in
cortical networks. 

The procedure relies on a /bottom-up/ approach: it measures quantities
at a microscopic scale (the cellular scale, \sim 10-100
\(\mu\mathrm{m}\)) to predict the behavior on a macroscopic scale
(from cortical columns to cortical areas, \sim 1-10 mm).

The nervous system is the part of an animal's body that controls the
body's functions (its voluntary and involuntary actions), it
coordinates and transmits signals to and from different parts of the
body (see the diagram in Figure [[fig:cns]]B).  The neocortex (Latin for
/new bark/) is the superficial sheet of the cerebral cortex, the
latter being the upper layer of the cerebral hemisphere (see Figure
[[fig:somato]]A), it appeared with the evolution of mammals and it is the
structure where the most complex cerebral functions (sensory
perception, language, generation of motor commands, etc...)  are
performed. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that render
those performances possible is a fundamental question in modern
biology.

The basic design of the neocortex is conserved across all mammals: 1)
it is subdivided into functional areas called cortical areas having a
precise cognitive function (see Figure [[fig:somato]]B) and 2) the
cortical surface corresponds to the juxtaposition of cortical columns
comprising about 10000-50000 neurons being each around 500
$\mu\mathrm{m}$ wide. A notable difference between small mammals
(e.g. rodents) and larger mammals (e.g. primates, see Figure
[[fig:somato]]B) is the presence of folds of the neocortical sheet that
allow an important increase of the neocortical surface given the
limited skull size.

 Neocortical tissue is mainly composed of neurons as well as glial
cells, the human brain contains about 100 billions neuronal cells and
500 billions glial cells. Neuronal cells process information and
transmit signals thanks to their electrophysiological and chemical
properties. Neurons are highly interconnected via synapses forming
recurrent and feedforward networks whose activation corresponds to
cognitive processes. Glial cells (from Greek /glue/) are traditionally
thought to: 1) surround neurons, hold them in place and insulate one
neuron from another 2) supply nutrients and dioxygen to neuronal cells
and 3) destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons. Though recent
evidences suggest that glial processes might have a more direct role
in neocortical function, this potential aspect of neocortical
processing will be largely ignored within this thesis, we hypothetize
that glial cells only participate to neocortical function by
maintaining the /homeostasis/ in neuronal assemblies: insuring the
stability of neuronal properties and synaptic transmission. We will
therefore focus on the neuronal aspect of neocortical processes.


A prominent feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization. It
can be divided into six layers according to different types of
neuronal cells (see Figure [[fig:diversity-laminar]]A) and different
connectivity properties (afferent, recurrent and projecting
connections). The functional role of this laminar organization is
still largely unresolved, but the layer specific connectivity scheme
(see Figure [[fig:diversity-laminar]]B) suggests that supra-granular
networks underlie cross-modality communication while infra-granular
networks might perform computations related to local cortical
features.

In *Work 1* and *Work 2*, we investigate how the biophysical and
morphological properties of layer V pyramidal neurons in mice visual
cortex shape their functional properties in a regime mimicking active
neocortical processing. In *Work 4*, we model a large-scale
excitatory-inhibitory Layer II-III network (\(\sim\)100mm^2) including
the horizontal fiber network that interconnects areas responding to
different sensory features.

*** Sensory processing as a model of neocortical computation

Cortical computation can be defined as the operations performed
between cortical representations (in a general sense, including brain
state, sensory stimuli, etc...). Sensory systems are of particular
interest as cortical representations encode information coming from
the physical world. The experimentalist can therefore manipulate those
physical quantity in a controlled fashion to establish relationships
between sensory stimuli and its neural representation. In particular,
in primary sensory areas, the relation with the physical world keeps a
relatively simple form. For example, the somatotopic map in the
primary somatosensory cortex, see Figure [[fig:somato]]C, reflects the
fact that neurons respond to a stimulus at a given location on the
skin, while higher order area along the somatosensory pathway would be
sensitive to more abstract features in the tactile stimulus.

Primary sensory areas therefore provide a good experimental system to
investigate the principles of cortical computation. This strategy
naturally implies the use of an appropriate recording technique to
image the neural representation, such as intracellular recording,
extracellular recordings, optical imaging, etc... In *Work 3*, we
investigate how the neural representation in the primary auditory
cortex of a simple auditory stimulus (a click of white noise) is
affected by the level of ongoing activity using intracellular
recordings /in vivo/. In *Work 4*, we investigate how two distinct
neural representations (encoding a single flash in two distinct visual
locations) interacts by using optical imaging /in vivo/.

*** Neocortical processing and population dynamics

Neuronal assemblies represent and process information through the
emission of stereotyped electrophysiological events: the actions
potentials. The information encoded by an assembly within a time
window is thus contained in its /raster activity/: the set of spike
trains across neurons. What are the quantities within this set that
are relevant for a /downstream/ readout ? This is still an open and
very controversial question. As an example, an influential theory
[[cite:Shadlen1994]], /rate-based/ coding states that the information is
carried by the temporal variation of the population firing rate
(defined over a short time bin). On the other-hand, the more general
/spike-based/ theory states that the temporal patterns of individual
spikes carry the information so that the population rate is a very
limited description of the neuronal asssembly. I will not review here
the arguments in favor of one view or the other, insightful reviews
can be found in the classical paper from [[citetext:Shadlen1994]] (in
favor of the /rate-based/ theory) or in [[citetext:Brette2015b]] (in favor
of the /spike-based/ theory). The purpose of this thesis is not to
take position in favor of one or the other theory (also given that a
definitive answer is unlikely to hold generally in the cortex in
general, e.g. olfactory system vs. visual system). Nonetheless, we
briefly argue here that, whatever the /neural code/, an accurate
description of population dynamics in neocortical networks is a
necessary prerequisite to the understanding of cortical
computation. In a /rate coding/ scheme, population dynamics constitute
the /neural code/, the increase of the firing of a given cortical
sub-population encodes a given sensory feature, the relevance of
understanding population dynamics is thus straightforward. In a
/temporal coding/ scheme, the population activity is not sufficient,
it is important to have a very precise description in the spike
timings and one should know exactly which neurons are spiking. In a
/temporal coding/ scheme (or in a /stochastic temporal coding/ scheme,
see [[citetext:Rossant2011]]), the robustness of the code relies on the
ability of neurons to behave as coincidence detectors [[cite:Softky1993]]
and this feature has been shown to critically rely on the properties
of the background activity [[cite:Rudolph2003,Rossant2011]], i.e. on
effects mediated by population dynamics. Finally, several canonical
effects are mediated by population dynamics: e.g. the
response-dependency on ongoing activity levels
[[cite:Arieli1996,DeWeese2004,Scholvinck2015,Lin2015]], or gain modulation
of sensory responses putatively mediated by top-down modulation of
cortical activity [[cite:Zagha2013,Harris2013]].

[[file:./figures/pop_dyn.png]]


We now give the precise definition of population dynamics adopted in
this thesis, as well as its relevance and limitations for the
description of neocortical processes. We define population dynamics as
the temporal variations of the instantaneous firing rate at the
population level. This definition is already problematic as an
instantaneous rate can not be defined, a firing rate has to be sampled
over a given time window. The question of the time-window thus becomes
critical, especially in the /rate/ vs. /temporal/ coding debate. We
take a rather low value: dt \(\sim\) 10ms, meaning that we focus on
slow dynamics, up to the \(\sim\) 100Hz frequency range. For a
population of size \(N\), the population firing rate is thus given by
\(\nu(t)=S(t)/N/dt\), where \(S(t)\) is the number of spikes between
\(t\) and \(t+dt\), we give an example of how such a quantity can be
determined using extracellular recordings in Figure [[fig:pop-rate]] (the
1ms bins followed by the 12ms Gaussian smoothing approximates our
\(\sim\) 10ms timescale). 

Because we define this firing rate as a firing probability (within
each time bin), we assume that neurons fire in an irregular manner
where this probabilistic view is relevant (see next section). This
also puts constraints on the range of firing rate values described by
population dynamics, values should not exceed 100Hz (probability of 1
in 10ms time bin). All cortical processes that corresponds to
instantaneous firing rate larger than 100Hz do not fit in our
framework of population dynamics. The precise spiking response seen in
various models of sensory processing, e.g. the response to single
tones in auditory cortex [[cite:Wehr2003]] or the response to natural
stimuli in primary visual cortex [[cite:Baudot2013]] typically represent
such processes. For those precise responses, our modeling framework is
inefficient and only the precise modeling of the precisely-timed
afferent stimulation could capture this type of responses. This thesis
thus focuses on describing /slow/ population dynamics and will thus
have an explanatory power for all phyiological processes mediated by
this slow dynamics (stimuli of low frequency content, effects of
ongoing activity, top-down modulations, lateral interactions, etc...).

In *Work 3*, we investigate how the post-synaptic response to low
amplitude stimuli is amplified by a strong level of ongoing recurrent
dynamics. In *Work 4*, we show that such a descritpion in terms of
population dynamics accurately reproduce the response to brief flashed
stimuli (of duration >10ms) in the primary visual cortex of fixating
monkey.

*** Theoretical models of neocortical dynamics

On the theoretical side, much effort has been devoted to design
theoretical models reproducing the characteristics of neocortical
activity /in vivo/. In particular, the regime characterizing the
/awake/ state has attacted much attention. In this regime, spontaneous
activity is characterized by irregular and weakly synchronized spiking
[[cite:Softky1993,Shadlen1994,Ecker2010,Renart2010]] as well as strong
membrane potential fluctuations at the neuronal level (reviewed in
[[citetext:Destexhe2003]]).

Such a stochastic-like regime has been successfully achieved in
/balanced recurrent networks/
[[cite:Tsodyks1995,Vreeswijk1996,Amit1997]]. The mechanism underlying this
regime within this architecture can be easily understood. If single
neurons have irregular spiking, they will produce fluctuating
excitatory and inhibitory input to a single neuron via recurrent
connections. Then, provided the network is /balanced/, so that
excitation and inhibition cancel each other statistically, neurons
will spike irregularly because spiking will result from the
fluctuations (a near random walk toward the threshold). We conclude
that, if the input of the neuron is irregular, it will produce
irregular spiking. This situation therefore enables the existence of
an asynchronous state where irregular spiking sustains itself in a
recurrent network. The core idea has been initially formulated in
networks of binary neurons [[cite:Vreeswijk1996]], since then, theoretical
work has increased the biological realism of this picture
[[cite:Amit1997,Brunel1999,Brunel2000,Vogels2005,ElBoustani2007,Kumar2008]].

The balanced network will be used as a theoretical basis all along the
thesis, either to reproduce synaptic input (*Work 1* and *Work 2*) or
to build networks (*Work 3* and *Work 4*). In *Work 4*, we adapt the
classical randomly sparsely connected balanced network model by
including an assymetry in the electrophysiological properties of
excitatory and inhibitory cells.

*** Analytical descriptions of collective dynamics

Thanks to their relative simplicity, those reduced theoretical model
of cortical assemblies have a notable advantage: they allow an
analytical description of the emergent collective dynamics (via
several well-choosen approximations, see [[citetext:Renart2004]] for a
review). Indeed, the reasoning of the previous section can be
formalized mathematically to obtain equations describing the
population dynamics. Those self-consistency approaches describing
recurrent dynamics are called /mean-field/ approaches (originally, the
same kind of self-consistent approach allowed to derive the
magnetization in spin glasses, i.e. the mean magnetic
field). Similarly to the situation of spin-glasses, they predict the
conditions of the regime's stability and they allow to calculate the
mean firing rate of the network as a function of its parameters
[[cite:Vreeswijk1996,Amit1997,Brunel2000,Latham2000,ElBoustani2009]]. For
example, /mean-field/ analysis predicts the conditions leading to
run-away activity (similar to epileptic discharge)
[[cite:Amit1997,Brunel2000]] or the emergence of fast oscillations
[[cite:Brunel1999,Brunel2000,Brunel2003]]. 

Interestingly, they also describe the network response to a given
afferent input [[cite:Vreeswijk1996,Amit1997,Ledoux2011]] and therefore
offer a very interesting possibility to describe neocortical
computation.

This last point is the main motivation behind this thesis. *Work 1*
and *Work 2* contributes to making those /mean-field/ formalism more
/biologically-realistic/. In *Work 4*, we also investigate the
explanatory power of one of those form of analytical descriptions (a
Markovian formalism combined with a semi-analytical approach, see
[[citetext:ElBoustani2009]]) in a network showing assymetric
electrophysiological properties between excitation and inhibition.

*** The transfer function of neocortical neurons

At the core of /mean-field/ formalisms lie the cellular /transfer
function/, i.e. the function that translate the presynaptic release
frequencies into a spiking probability (the transfer function is
defined within our /population dynamics/ framework). Those /transfer
functions/ account for the cellular computation and, within the
/mean-field/ picture (that might fail at capturing network dynamics,
see e.g. [[citetext:Ostojic2014]]), the network dynamics is solely the
recurrent amplification of this cellular computation. 

The /transfer function/ is thus the key ingredient of network dynamics
within this framework. This is also the important insight of the
/mean-field/ description: having highlighted the crucial features at
the cellular level that controls population dynamics. The hypothesis
behind this thesis is therefore that by accurately describing the
neuronal transfer function, we will accurately predict emergent
phenomena at the network level.

Characterizing the transfer functions of neocortical neurons is the
focus of *Work 1* and *Work 2*. Neocortical cells are very complex
units: they are characterized by a extended dendritic arborization
while the spike initiation mechanism lies at the axon initial segment,
close to the soma. To deal with this complexity, we formulated an
approximation that arbitrarily separate the problem into two distinct
problem to make it amenable to analysis. First, dendritic integration
of irregular excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input will shape the
properties of the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma. We
performed this analysis in *Work 2* by using cable theory
[[cite:Rall1962,Rall1977]]. Then, we investigate how those membrane
potential fluctuations at the soma are translated into spikes. This is
the focus of *Work 1*, we performed this analysis /in vitro/ on layer
V neocortical cells of young mice visual cortex\footnote{It could be asked here. Why performing experimental cellular biophysics 60 years after the ground-breaking study of Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) ? Since then, the dynamics of ionic-channels have been extensively studied and characterized in isolated preparations. This analysis could thus be done numerically. Nonetheless, cellular biophysics in mammalian neocortical neurons does not easily reduce to ionic-channels dynamics, either because of compartmentalization specificities (McCormick et al., 2007; Kole and Stuart, 2008; Brette, 2013) or exotic channel-gating properties (Naundorf et al., 2006, 2007). As those mammalian-specific properties (for which there is no theoretical consensus) might have a critical impact on the transfer function (Ilin et al. 2013), it requires an experimental determination.}.

In this thesis, 

while investigating the transfer function /in vitro/ we found that
neocortical neurons exhibited a strong cell-to-cell variability.

*** Rationale behind a /bottom-up/ approach: models of high empirical content

At this stage, it is worth comparing the theoretical model resulting
from our /bottom-up/ approach to other models in the litterature.

Competing models for macroscopic population dynamics are
phenomenological models, the most prominent example being the model of
[[citetext:Rubin2013]] for primary visual cortex computation. We will
focus on this model within this discussion. This model has only two
variables: the excitatory and inhibitory population activities
(comparable to our two population model). It has also very few
parameters: the 3 parameters of their /power law/ input-output
function and the connectivity parameters. This very low number of
parameters might be seen  as a 

The number of parameters is obvisouly a lot larger (ionic channel
parameters, synaptic quantities, membrane quantities, morphology
parameters, circuit properties, ...)


We now examine this comparison in the light of an epistemological
consideration: the distinction between /empirical content/ and
/empirical accuracy/ (adapted from [[citetext:Brette2015a]], where it was
discussed for models of spike initiation). The empirical accuracy

We identified an important principle, the final effect for the

- cellular gain modulation [[cite:Ho2000,Chance2002]]. This mechanism is
  in favor of the quiescent-state.

- recruitment within the network to amplify the stimulus through the
  recurrent connectivity. This mechanism is in favor of the active-state.


The potentiation of the Up-state increases as a function of the number
of networks when arranged in a feedforward manner.


Requires great care about what is actually measured. Somatic
intracellular do not predict the same effect as multi-unit
activity. The predictions of this model is that in terms of multi-unit
activity, the response should be systematically lower in the
Down-state than in the Up-state. A notable exception would appear for
very strong stimuli [[cite:Ho2000]] , but this would presumably result ina
pathological situation as this effect appears when all neurons respond
[[cite:Ho2000]].

Those ingredients are also present in our mopulation model of
neocortical integration(though a bit hidden by the strongest effect of
the assymetries in excitabilities). Is the variability found in
