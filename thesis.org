Undesrtanding

This thesis devellops a modeling procedure to obtain theoretical
descriptions of population activity in cortical networks. The
procedure rely on a /bottom-up/ approach: it measures quantities at a
microscopic scale (the cellular scale, \sim 10-100 \(\mu\mathrm{m}\))
to predict the behavior on a macroscopic scale (from cortical columns
to cortical areas, \sim 1-10 mm).

The nervous system is the part of an animal's body that controls the
body's functions (its voluntary and involuntary actions), it
coordinates and transmits signals to and from different parts of the
body (see the diagram in Figure [[fig:cns]]B).  The neocortex (Latin for
/new bark/) is the superficial sheet of the cerebral cortex, the
latter being the upper layer of the cerebral hemisphere (see Figure
[[fig:cns]]C and [[fig:neocortex]]A), it appeared with the evolution of
mammals and it is the structure where the most complex cerebral
functions (sensory perception, language, generation of motor commands,
etc...)  are performed. Understanding the physiological mechanisms
that render those performances possible is a fundamental question in
modern biology.

The basic design of the neocortex is conserved across all mammals: 1)
it is subdivided into functional areas called cortical areas having a
precise cognitive function and 2) the cortical surface corresponds to
the juxtaposition of cortical columns comprising about 10000-50000
neurons being each around 500 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wide. A notable
difference between small mammals (e.g. rodents) and larger mammals
(e.g. primates) is the presence of folds of the neocortical sheet that
allow an important increase of the neocortical surface given the
limited skull size.

 Neocortical tissue is mainly composed of neurons as well as glial
cells, the human brain contains about 100 billions neuronal cells and
500 billions glial cells. Neuronal cells process information and
transmit signals thanks to their electrophysiological and chemical
properties. Neurons are highly interconnected via synapses forming
recurrent and feedforward networks whose activation corresponds to
cognitive processes. Glial cells (from Greek /glue/) are traditionally
thought to: 1) surround neurons, hold them in place and insulate one
neuron from another 2) supply nutrients and dioxygen to neuronal cells
and 3) destroy pathogens and remove dead neurons. Though recent
evidences suggest that glial processes might have a more direct role
in neocortical function, this potential aspect of neocortical
processing will be largely ignored within this thesis, we hypothetize
that glial cells only participate to neocortical function by
maintaining the /homeostasis/ in neuronal assemblies: insuring the
stability of neuronal properties and synaptic transmission. We will
therefore focus on the neuronal aspect of neocortical processes.

A prominent feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization. It
can be divided into six layers according to different types of
neuronal cells and different connectivity properties (afferent,
recurrent and projecting connections). The functional role of this
laminar organization is still debated, but [[bruno stuff]].

*** Sensory systems as a model of neocortical processing: 

Sensory systems are of particular interest for neuroscientists as they
encode information coming from the physical world. The experimentalist
can therefore manipulate those physical quantity in a controlled
fashion to establish relationships between sensory stimuli and its
neural representation. Those findings provide a direct access to
neural representation of stimuli and allow

*** Neocortical processing and population dynamics

Neuronal assemblies represent and process information through the
emission of stereotyped electrophysiological events: the actions
potentials. The information encoded by an assembly within a time
window is thus contained in its /raster activity/: the set of spike
trains across neurons. What are the quantities whithin this set that
are relevant for a /downstream/ readout ? This is still an open and
very controversial question. As an example, an influential theory,
/rate-based/ coding states that the information is carried by the
temporal variation of the population firing rate (defined over a short
time bin). On the other-hand, the more general /spike-based/ theory
states that the temporal patterns of individual spikes carry the
information so that the population rate is a very limited description
of the neuronal asssembly. I will not review here the arguments in
favor of one view or the other, an insightful review can be found in
[[citetext:Brette2015b]].

 We introduce here the biological system whose functional properties
 are investigated in this thesis: the mammalian *neocortex*. This part
 is not thought to be an extensive review of the current knowledge
 about this complex brain structure, we briefly present the
 physiological concepts on which this study relies. At the end of each
 section, we emphasize how those concepts relates to the Results of
 this thesis. This overview is based on the textbook by

Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 600 million
years ago. The *nervous system* is the part of an animal's body that
controls the body's functions (its voluntary and involuntary
actions). The nervous system coordinates and transmits signals to and
from different parts of its body (see the diagram in Figure
[[fig:cns]]B). In vertebrate species it consists of two main parts: the
*central nervous system* (CNS) and the *peripheral nervous
system*. The central nervous system (defined as the brain and spinal
cord, see Figure [[fig:cns]]A) is usually considered to have seven basic
parts: the spinal cord, the medulla, the pons,the cerebellum, the
midbrain, the diencephalon, and the cerebellar hemishperes (or
cerebrum), see Figure [[fig:cns]]C.

*** Neocortical physiology

 The neocortex is a brain structure appearing with the evolution of
 mammals. It is the structure where the most complex cerebral
 functions (sensory perception, language, generation of motor
 commands, etc...) are performed. One can guess its functional
 importance in humans by realizing how energetically /expensive/ is
 this relatively tiny piece of tissue: while being only \sim 2% of the
 body mass, it represents respectively \sim 25 % and \sim 20% of the
 glucose and dioxygen consumption.

 The neocortex, (Latin for /new bark/) is the superficial sheet, the
 top \sim 1mm in humans, of the *cerebral cortex*, the latter being
 the upper layer of the cerebral hemisphere (see Figure [[fig:cns]]C and
 [[fig:neocortex]]A). The basic design of the neocortex is conserved
 across all mammals: 1) it is subdivided into functional areas called
 *cortical areas* having a precise cognitive function (e.g. ) and 2)
 the cortical surface corresponds to the juxtaposition of *cortical
 columns* comprising about 10000-50000 neurons being each around 500
 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wide. A notable difference between small mammals
 (e.g. rodents) and larger mammals (e.g. primates) is the presence of
 *folds* (/giry/ and /sulci/) of the neocortical sheet that allow an
 important increase of the neocortical surface given the limited skull
 size.

[[file:./figures/neocortical_anatomy.png]]

 Neocortical tissue is mainly composed of *neurons* as well as *glial
 cells*, the human brain contains about 100 billions neuronal cells
 and 500 billions glial cells. The *grey matter* is the part contaning
 the neuronal cell bodies und unmyelinated fibers, while the deeper
 *white matter* is composed of the myelinated fibers. Neuronal cells
 process information and transmit signals thanks to their
 electrophysiological and chemical properties. Neurons are highly
 interconnected via *synapses* forming recurrent and feedforward
 networks whose activation corresponds to cognitive processes. Glial
 cells (from Greek /glue/) are traditionally thought to: 1) surround
 neurons, hold them in place and insulate one neuron from another 2)
 supply nutrients and dioxygen to neuronal cells and 3) destroy
 pathogens and remove dead neurons. Though recent evidences suggest
 that glial processes might have a more direct role in neocortical
 function, this potential aspect of neocortical processing will be
 largely ignored within this thesis, we hypothetize that glial cells
 only participate to neocortical function by maintaining the
 /homeostasis/ in neuronal assemblies: insuring the stability of
 neuronal properties and synaptic transmission. We will therefore
 focus on the neuronal aspect of neocortical processes.

*** Laminar structure

A prominent feature of the neocortex is its laminar organization. It
can be divided into six layers according to different types of
neuronal cells and different connectivity properties (afferent,
recurrent and projecting connections). From pial surface to white
matter (see Figure [[fig:laminar-structure]]), we can distinguish:

- *Layer I*: the molecular layer. It consists mainly of extensions of
  apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal neurons and horizontally
  oriented axons, as well as glial cells. Those inputs onto apical
  tufts are thought to be important for /feedback/ control of local
  cortical computations. It also contains few neurons that, in the
  adult brain, seem to be only GABAergic interneurons.

- *Layer II/III*: the external granular layer. It contains small pyramidal
  neurons (the apical arbors are moderately develloped because of the
  proximity to the pial surface) and numerous stellate neurons. They
  receive input from the layer IV excitatory neurons and have a strong
  interlaminar recurrent connectivity within a cortical column.

- *Layer III*: the external pyramidal layer. It contains predominantly
  small and medium-size pyramidal neurons, as well as non-pyramidal
  excitatory and inhibitory neurons with vertically oriented
  intracortical axons. The intracolumnar circuitry of layer III
  pyramidal neurons is dominated by local intralaminar connections and
  the layer IV translaminar input. Recent evidence suggests that this
  is also true for at least a subpopulation of L III inhibitory cells,
  i.e. the fast-spiking basket cells (Xu and Callaway, 2009). The
  transcolumnar circuitry of L III pyramidal cells has been more
  difficult to study in the slice. Although structurally and
  functionally supragranular transcolumnar pathways have been
  described (Fox, 2002; Brecht et al., 2003; Broser et al., 2008),
  they are much less numerous in L III than in L II (Larsen and
  Callaway, 2006; Bruno et al., 2009)( own still unpublished
  results). This may be one reason for the so far lacking paired
  recordings of L III pyramidal neurons located in neighboring
  columns, in vitro and in vivo. Since the connection probability
  decreases monotonically with distance (Holmgren et al., 2003), new
  methods to pre-identify connected neurons (Wickersham et al., 2007)
  have to be further refined (Boldogkoi et al., 2009), in order to
  study the precise functional and morphological determinants of
  transcolumnar L III circuits (which is true for all other layers as
  well). Concerning the output of L III, consistently, L V(b) has been
  found to be the major intracolumnar target structure which
  represents one of the backbone feedforward projections of the
  “canonical microcircuitry” (Martin and Whitteridge, 1984; Thomson
  and Bannister, 2003; Kampa et al., 2006; Lefort et al.,
  2009). However, evidence has accumulated that also a functionally
  weak but anatomically consistent feedback projection to L IV
  excitatory neurons is formed (Martin and Whitteridge, 1984; Schubert
  et al., 2003; Larsen and Callaway, 2006; Lefort et al., 2009).

- *Layer IV*: the internal granular layer. It contains different types
  of stellate and pyramidal neurons, and is the main target of
  thalamocortical afferents from thalamus type Cneurons[6] as well as
  intra-hemispheric corticocortical afferents.

- *Layer V*: the internal pyramidal layer. It contains large pyramidal
  neurons which give rise to axons leaving the cortex and running down
  to subcortical structures (such as the basal ganglia). In the
  primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe, layer V contains Betz
  cells, whose axons travel through the internal capsule, the brain
  stem and the spinal cord forming the corticospinal tract, which is
  the main pathwayfor voluntary motor control.  

The cortical layers are not simply stacked one over the other; there
exists characteristic connections between different layers and
neuronal types, which span all the thickness of the cortex. These
cortical microcircuits are grouped into cortical columns and
minicolumns. It has been proposed that the minicolumns are the basic
functional units of the cortex. [9,sdkfjsdfjh] In 1957, Vernon
Mountcastle showed that the functional properties of the cortex change
abruptly between laterally adjacent points; however, they are
continuous in the direction perpendicular to the surface. Later works
have provided evidence of the presence of functionally distinct
cortical columns in the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959),[10:skdhfsd]
auditory cortex, and associative cortex.  Cortical areas that lack a
layer IV are called agranular. Cortical areas that have only a
rudimentary layer IV are called dysgranular.[11;sdkshdf] Information
processing within each layer is determined by different temporal
dynamics with that in the layers II/III having a slow 2 Hz oscillation
while that in layer V having a fast 10–15 Hz one.[12]

*** Neurons in neocortex

As already suggested in the previous section, the neocortex is
characterized by a strong diversity in cellular types. Cells are
usually classified according to electrophysiological, morphological,
chemical and genetic markers. [[(check this on Markram interneurons
review)]]

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\linewidth
#+LABEL: fig:schematic-neuron
#+CAPTION: Description of a neocortical neuron, taken from [[url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron]]
[[file:./figures/schematic_neuron.png]]

Nonetheless, all neurons have some common features, see Figure
[[fig:schematic-neuron]]. A nerve cell contains a nucleus delimited by a
plasmid membrane. The cytoplasm contains organites common to all cells
(endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, Golgi apparatus, etc...). The
cell body, or *soma*, is the central part of the cell, its typical
diameter is around 20 \(\mu\mathrm{m}\). Nerve cells have two well
separated protrusions : the *dendrites* and the *axon*, receiving the
input and sending the output respectively. The dendritic arbor is a
ramified structure receiving contacts from other projecting neurons:
the *synapses*. When presynaptic neurons activate, a neurotransmitter
release happens at the synapse what opens selective ionic channels to
inject a current through the postsynaptic membrane. Those synaptic
currents sum along the dendritic arbor to reach the somatic and axon
hillock compartments. For high enough depolarizations, an *action
potential* is triggered and will propagate along the axon. The axonal
terminal also has ramifications and forms *presynaptic boutons*
([[check]]) onto other nerve cells, and will, in turn, induce
post-synaptic currents in those target cells when active.

We now describe differences between neocortical cells, the main cells
found in the neocortical sheet are shown on Figure [[cells-of
neocortex]]. A first distinction comes from the dichotomy between
*excitatory* and *inhibitory* neurons, indeed because of their
different neurotransmitter type (e.g. glutamate for the excitatory
cells or GABAa for the inhibitory cells), nerve cells can induce
either depolarizing currents or hyperpolarizing currents (promoting or
inhibiting the triggering of a spike). Neurons also differ in their
dendritic arborescence, their electrophysiological properties [[(see the
illustration of a Fast Spiking cell vs a Regular Spiking cell)]] as well
as their axonal projections.

In this thesis, 

*** Rationale behind a /bottom-up/ approach: models of high empirical content

At this stage, it is worth comparing the theoretical model resulting
from our /bottom-up/ approach to other models in the litterature.

Competing models for macroscopic population dynamics are
phenomenological models, the most prominent example being the model of
[[citetext:Rubin2013]] for primary visual cortex computation. We will
focus on this model within this discussion. This model has only two
variables: the excitatory and inhibitory population activities
(comparable to our two population model). It has also very few
parameters: the 3 parameters of their /power law/ input-output
function and the connectivity parameters. This very low number of
parameters might be seen  as a 

The number of parameters is obvisouly a lot larger (ionic channel
parameters, synaptic quantities, membrane quantities, morphology
parameters, circuit properties, ...)


We now examine this comparison in the light of an epistemological
consideration: the distinction between /empirical content/ and
/empirical accuracy/ (adapted from [[citetext:Brette2015a]], where it was
discussed for models of spike initiation). The empirical accuracy
