Nous introduisons ici les concepts utilisés dans cette thèse.

** Information processing in the early sensory system

Sensory systems are of particular interest for neuroscientists as they
encode information coming from the physical world, which the
experimentalist can manipulate in a controlled fashion to establish
relationships between sensory stimuli its neural representation. 

Because the experimentalist can control variables from
the

*** Organizing principles

Though all sensory systems in mammalians (visual, auditory, olfactory
and somato-sensory) have their unique features, a common organizing
principle can be identified for the early pathway (at least to a first
order approximation): sensory transducer project to the thalamus, who
in turn projects to the primary sensory area.

*** What do we know about encoding strategies of sensory information in the mammalian CNS ?

Basically, very few. Following the argument revewed in
[[citet:Brette2015]], the experimental work on information processing of
sensory input has mostly focused on finding /neural correlates/ of
sensory processing,

*** Scope of the study: population rate dynamics in neocortical networks

- Receptive field in sensory systems: stimulus presentation correlates
  with increase of population activity

*** Contribution: investigating the cellular and circuit mechanims constraining population rate dynamics in neocortical networks

** Neocortical physiology

*** Neurons in neocortex

- classes

- morphologies

*** Synaptic transmission

synapses

*** Networks 

- Layers

*** Action potential

*** Signal propagation in dendritic structures

cable theory

** A theoretical framework to describe neocortical population dynamics

*** Modeling asychronous irregular dynamics

El Boustani & Destexhe, 2009

**** TODO investigate what is the output when you have the transfer function !

- redo the numerical simulations of networks

- redo the analysis

*** The core of the description: the neuronal /transfer function/

*** Determining the input-output properties of neocortical neurons in the asynchronous regime

**** Specificity of neocortical neurons: why doing current-clamp experiments in 2015 ?


**** The problem of the electrophysiological characterization in neocortical neurons


**** classical characterization : Hodgkin-Huxley like approach


**** :TODO: characterization of sodium channel properties in xenopus cultures

- show that it works

- maybe do some noise protocols and show that the electrophysiological
characterization is able to predict the response to noisy input.


**** :TODO: characterization of sodium channel properties in neocortical neurons

- show that it doesn't work

- $\rightarrow$ need to characterize the input-output function


**** The compartementalization problem

- take a compartimentalized model and show the space clamp problem

- solution: having a phenomenological description of single cell
  computation, not based on a detailed understanding of the
  biophysical properties of neocortical neurons

*** A reduced model of the cortical sheet

- Ring model with propagation delays

- propagating waves

*** Incorporating biophysical cellular features

- network RS/FS

- network with extended dendritic structures
