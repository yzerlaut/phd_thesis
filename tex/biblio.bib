abstract = {Neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo are subject to an intense synaptic background activity but little is known of how this activity affects cellular responsiveness and what function it may serve. These issues were examined in morphologically reconstructed neocortical pyramidal neurons in which synaptic background activity was simulated based on recent measurements in cat parietal cortex. We show that background activity can be decomposed into two components: a tonically active conductance and voltage fluctuations. Previous studies have mostly focused on the conductance effect, revealing that background activity is responsible for a decrease in responsiveness, which imposes severe conditions of coincidence of inputs necessary to discharge the cell. It is shown here, in contrast, that responsiveness is enhanced if voltage fluctuations are taken into account; in this case the model can produce responses to inputs that would normally be subthreshold. This effect is analyzed by dissecting and comparing the different components of background activity, as well as by evaluating the contribution of parameters such as the dendritic morphology, the distribution of leak currents, the value of axial resistivity, the densities of voltage-dependent currents, and the release parameters underlying background activity. Interestingly, the model's optimal responsiveness was obtained when voltage fluctuations were of the same order as those measured intracellularly in vivo. Possible consequences were also investigated at the population level, where the presence of background activity allowed networks of pyramidal neurons to instantaneously detect inputs that are small compared with the classical detection threshold. These results suggest, at the single-cell level, that the presence of voltage fluctuations has a determining influence on cellular responsiveness and that these should be taken into account in models of background activity. At the network level, we predict that background activity provides the necessary drive for detecting events that would normally be undetectable. Experiments are suggested to explore this possible functional role for background activity.},

abstract = {A large variety of neuron models are used in theoretical and computational neuroscience, and among these, single-compartment models are a popular kind. These models do not explicitly include the dendrites or the axon, and range from the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model to various flavors of integrate-and-fire (IF) models. The main classes of models differ in the way spikes are initiated. Which one is the most realistic? Starting with some general epistemological considerations, I show that the notion of realism comes in two dimensions: empirical content (the sort of predictions that a model can produce) and empirical accuracy (whether these predictions are correct). I then examine the realism of the main classes of single-compartment models along these two dimensions, in light of recent experimental evidence.},

@article{Rubin2013,
abstract = {Neurons in sensory cortex integrate multiple influences to parse objects and support perception. Across multiple cortical areas, integration is characterized by two neuronal response properties: (1) surround suppression-modulatory contextual stimuli suppress responses to driving stimuli; and (2) "normalization"-responses to multiple driving stimuli add sublinearly. These depend on input strength: for weak driving stimuli, contextual influences facilitate or more weakly suppress and summation becomes linear or supralinear. Understanding the circuit operations underlying integration is critical to understanding cortical function and disease. We present a simple, general theory. A wealth of integrative properties, including the above, emerge robustly from four cortical circuit properties: (1) supralinear neuronal input/output functions; (2) sufficiently strong recurrent excitation; (3) feedback inhibition; and (4) simple spatial properties of intracortical connections. Integrative properties emerge dynamically as circuit properties, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing similar behaviors. In new recordings in visual cortex, we confirm key model predictions.},

@article{Chance2002,
abstract = {Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded in behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of "background" synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron acts as a gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory drive.},

abstract = {Axons are generally considered as reliable transmission cables in which stable propagation occurs once an action potential is generated. Axon dysfunction occupies a central position in many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons. Recent findings suggest that the functional and computational repertoire of the axon is much richer than traditionally thought. Beyond classical axonal propagation, intrinsic voltage-gated ionic currents together with the geometrical properties of the axon determine several complex operations that not only control signal processing in brain circuits but also neuronal timing and synaptic efficacy. Recent evidence for the implication of these forms of axonal computation in the short-term dynamics of neuronal communication is discussed. Finally, we review how neuronal activity regulates both axon morphology and axonal function on a long-term time scale during development and adulthood.},

@article{Wendt1992,
abstract = {The results of studies on modulation of Na channel function are often difficult to interpret due to time-dependent changes in channel kinetics. Although the "tight-seal" whole cell voltage-clamp technique has proved very useful in studying the properties of the cardiac Na current, the spontaneous shift of parameters of inactivation and activation gating to more negative potential is a serious limitation to the use of the technique. The shifts are believed to result from changes in the intracellular milieu effected by dialysis; moreover, use of a variety of different anions and cations in the internal micropipette solution has not obviated the problem. The perforated-patch technique permits low-resistance intracellular access without free dialysis between the intracellular solution and the recording micropipette. We have compared steady-state inactivation and peak current-voltage relationship of whole cell Na currents measured with the conventional whole cell and perforated-patch techniques in rabbit atrial myocytes at 17 degrees C. Although gating parameters shifted to more negative potentials when recorded with the conventional technique, stable kinetics could be observed for up to 150 min with the perforated-patch technique. The potential for one-half Na channel inactivation was -73 +/- 5.1 mV and is consistent with measurements made using indirect techniques such as upstroke velocity measurements. The fact that the intracellular milieu is left relatively intact makes the approach attractive for studying modulation of the Na current by neurotransmitters and hormones.},

If this is approximated as white noise, the amplitude of the modulation of the firing rate in response to an input current oscillating at frequency omega decreases as 1/square root[omega] and lags the input by 45 degrees in phase. However, if filtering due to realistic synaptic dynamics is included, the firing rate is modulated by a finite amount even in the limit omega-->infinity and the phase lag is eliminated. Thus, through its effect on noise inputs, realistic synaptic dynamics can ensure unlagged neuronal responses to high-frequency inputs.},

abstract = {We consider a model of an integrate-and-fire neuron with synaptic current dynamics, in which the synaptic time constant tau' is much smaller than the membrane time constant tau. We calculate analytically the firing frequency of such a neuron for inputs described by a random Gaussian process. We find that the first order correction to the frequency due to tau' is proportional to the square root of the ratio between these time constants radicaltau'/tau. This implies that the correction is important even when the synaptic time constant is small compared with that of the potential. The frequency of a neuron with tau'>0 can be reduced to that of the basic IF neuron (corresponding to tau'=1) using an "effective" threshold which has a linear dependence on radical tau'/tau. Numerical simulations show a very good agreement with the analytical result, and permit an extrapolation of the "effective" threshold to higher orders in radical tau'/tau. The obtained frequency agrees with simulation data for a wide range of parameters.},

@article{Fourcaud-Trocme2003,
abstract = {This study examines the ability of neurons to track temporally varying inputs, namely by investigating how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron is modulated by a noisy input with a small sinusoidal component with frequency (f). Using numerical simulations of conductance-based neurons and analytical calculations of one-variable nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons, we characterized the dependence of this modulation on f. For sufficiently high noise, the neuron acts as a low-pass filter. The modulation amplitude is approximately constant for frequencies up to a cutoff frequency, fc, after which it decays. The cutoff frequency increases almost linearly with the firing rate. For higher frequencies, the modulation amplitude decays as C/falpha, where the power alpha depends on the spike initiation mechanism. For conductance-based models, alpha = 1, and the prefactor C depends solely on the average firing rate and a spike "slope factor," which determines the sharpness of the spike initiation. These results are attributable to the fact that near threshold, the sodium activation variable can be approximated by an exponential function. Using this feature, we propose a simplified one-variable model, the "exponential integrate-and-fire neuron," as an approximation of a conductance-based model. We show that this model reproduces the dynamics of a simple conductance-based model extremely well. Our study shows how an intrinsic neuronal property (the characteristics of fast sodium channels) determines the speed with which neurons can track changes in input.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the understanding of the dynamics of populations of spiking neurones are reviewed. These studies shed light on how a population of neurones can follow arbitrary variations in input stimuli, how the dynamics of the population depends on the type of noise, and how recurrent connections influence the dynamics. The importance of inhibitory feedback for the generation of irregularity in single cell behaviour is emphasized. Examples of computation that recurrent networks with excitatory and inhibitory cells can perform are then discussed. Maintenance of a network state as an attractor of the system is discussed as a model for working memory function, in both object and spatial modalities. These models can be used to interpret and make predictions about electrophysiological data in the awake monkey.},

abstract = {We study analytically the dynamics of a network of sparsely connected inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons in a regime where individual neurons emit spikes irregularly and at a low rate. In the limit when the number of neurons --> infinity, the network exhibits a sharp transition between a stationary and an oscillatory global activity regime where neurons are weakly synchronized. The activity becomes oscillatory when the inhibitory feedback is strong enough. The period of the global oscillation is found to be mainly controlled by synaptic times but depends also on the characteristics of the external input. In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global oscillations of finite coherence time generically exist both above and below the critical inhibition threshold. Their characteristics are determined as functions of systems parameters in these two different regions. The results are found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations.},

@article{Rauch2003,
abstract = {In the intact brain neurons are constantly exposed to intense synaptic activity. This heavy barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was recreated in vitro by injecting a noisy current, generated as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, into the soma of rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The response to such in vivo-like currents was studied systematically by analyzing the time development of the instantaneous spike frequency, and when possible, the stationary mean spike frequency as a function of both the mean and the variance of the input current. All cells responded with an in vivo-like action potential activity with stationary statistics that could be sustained throughout long stimulation intervals (tens of seconds), provided the frequencies were not too high. The temporal evolution of the response revealed the presence of mechanisms of fast and slow spike frequency adaptation, and a medium duration mechanism of facilitation. For strong input currents, the slow adaptation mechanism made the spike frequency response nonstationary. The minimal frequencies that caused strong slow adaptation (a decrease in the spike rate by more than 1 Hz/s), were in the range 30-80 Hz and depended on the pipette solution used. The stationary response function has been fitted by two simple models of integrate-and-fire neurons endowed with a frequency-dependent modification of the input current. This accounts for all the fast and slow mechanisms of adaptation and facilitation that determine the stationary response, and proved necessary to fit the model to the experimental data. The coefficient of variability of the interspike interval was also in part captured by the model neurons, by tuning the parameters of the model to match the mean spike frequencies only. We conclude that the integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency-dependent adaptation/facilitation is an adequate model reduction of cortical cells when the mean spike-frequency response to in vivo-like currents with stationary statistics is considered.},

@article{Platkiewicz2010,
abstract = {In central neurons, the threshold for spike initiation can depend on the stimulus and varies between cells and between recording sites in a given cell, but it is unclear what mechanisms underlie this variability. Properties of ionic channels are likely to play a role in threshold modulation. We examined in models the influence of Na channel activation, inactivation, slow voltage-gated channels and synaptic conductances on spike threshold. We propose a threshold equation which quantifies the contribution of all these mechanisms. It provides an instantaneous time-varying value of the threshold, which applies to neurons with fluctuating inputs. We deduce a differential equation for the threshold, similar to the equations of gating variables in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, which describes how the spike threshold varies with the membrane potential, depending on channel properties. We find that spike threshold depends logarithmically on Na channel density, and that Na channel inactivation and K channels can dynamically modulate it in an adaptive way: the threshold increases with membrane potential and after every action potential. Our equation was validated with simulations of a previously published multicompartemental model of spike initiation. Finally, we observed that threshold variability in models depends crucially on the shape of the Na activation function near spike initiation (about -55 mV), while its parameters are adjusted near half-activation voltage (about -30 mV), which might explain why many models exhibit little threshold variability, contrary to experimental observations. We conclude that ionic channels can account for large variations in spike threshold.},

abstract = {In cortical neurons, spikes are initiated in the axon initial segment. Seen at the soma, they appear surprisingly sharp. A standard explanation is that the current coming from the axon becomes sharp as the spike is actively backpropagated to the soma. However, sharp initiation of spikes is also seen in the input-output properties of neurons, and not only in the somatic shape of spikes; for example, cortical neurons can transmit high frequency signals. An alternative hypothesis is that Na channels cooperate, but it is not currently supported by direct experimental evidence. I propose a simple explanation based on the compartmentalization of spike initiation. When Na channels are placed in the axon, the soma acts as a current sink for the Na current. I show that there is a critical distance to the soma above which an instability occurs, so that Na channels open abruptly rather than gradually as a function of somatic voltage.},

abstract = {Randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are known to display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. However, it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models, or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons, such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS), regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic properties such as adaptation and low-threshold bursting activity are crucial for the genesis and control of AI states in thalamocortical networks.},

Most of models have considered balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons in which AI states are sustained through recurrent sparse connectivity, with or without external input. In this letter we propose a mesoscopic description of such AI states. Using master equation formalism, we derive a second-order mean-field set of ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of randomly connected balanced networks. This formalism takes into account finite size effects and is applicable to any neuron model as long as its transfer function can be characterized. We compare the predictions of this approach with numerical simulations for different network configurations and parameter spaces. Considering the randomly connected network as a unit, this approach could be used to build large-scale networks of such connected units, with an aim to model activity states constrained by macroscopic measurements, such as voltage-sensitive dye imaging.},

abstract = {We studied the dynamics of large networks of spiking neurons with conductance-based (nonlinear) synapses and compared them to networks with current-based (linear) synapses. For systems with sparse and inhibition-dominated recurrent connectivity, weak external inputs induced asynchronous irregular firing at low rates. Membrane potentials fluctuated a few millivolts below threshold, and membrane conductances were increased by a factor 2 to 5 with respect to the resting state. This combination of parameters characterizes the ongoing spiking activity typically recorded in the cortex in vivo. Many aspects of the asynchronous irregular state in conductance-based networks could be sufficiently well characterized with a simple numerical mean field approach. In particular, it correctly predicted an intriguing property of conductance-based networks that does not appear to be shared by current-based models: they exhibit states of low-rate asynchronous irregular activity that persist for some period of time even in the absence of external inputs and without cortical pacemakers. Simulations of larger networks (up to 350,000 neurons) demonstrated that the survival time of self-sustained activity increases exponentially with network size.},

@article{Amit1997,
abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

abstract = {The study of several aspects of the collective dynamics of interacting neurons can be highly simplified if one assumes that the statistics of the synaptic input is the same for a large population of similarly behaving neurons (mean field approach). In particular, under such an assumption, it is possible to determine and study all the equilibrium points of the network dynamics when the neuronal response to noisy, in vivo-like, synaptic currents is known. The response function can be computed analytically for simple integrate-and-fire neuron models and it can be measured directly in experiments in vitro. Here we review theoretical and experimental results about the neural response to noisy inputs with stationary statistics. These response functions are important to characterize the collective neural dynamics that are proposed to be the neural substrate of working memory, decision making and other cognitive functions. Applications to the case of time-varying inputs are reviewed in a companion paper (Giugliano et al. in Biol Cybern, 2008). We conclude that modified integrate-and-fire neuron models are good enough to reproduce faithfully many of the relevant dynamical aspects of the neuronal response measured in experiments on real neurons in vitro.},

@article{McCormick1985,
abstract = {Slices of sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortex from guinea pigs were maintained in vitro and bathed in a normal physiological medium. Electrophysiological properties of neurons were assessed with intracellular recording techniques. Some neurons were identified morphologically by intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH. Three distinct neuronal classes of electrophysiological behavior were observed; these were termed regular spiking, bursting, and fast spiking. The physiological properties of neurons from sensorimotor and anterior cingulate areas did not differ significantly. Regular-spiking cells were characterized by action potentials with a mean duration of 0.80 ms at one-half amplitude, a ratio of maximum rate of spike rise to maximum rate of fall of 4.12, and a prominent afterhyperpolarization following a train of spikes. The primary slope of initial spike frequency versus injected current intensity was 241 Hz/nA. During prolonged suprathreshold current pulses the frequency of firing adapted strongly. When local synaptic pathways were activated, all cells were transiently excited and then strongly inhibited. Bursting cells were distinguished by their ability to generate endogenous, all-or-none bursts of three to five action potentials. Their properties were otherwise very similar to regular-spiking cells. The ability to generate a burst was eliminated when the membrane was depolarized to near the firing threshold with tonic current. By contrast, hyperpolarization of regular-spiking (i.e., nonbursting) cells did not uncover latent bursting tendencies. The action potentials of fast-spiking cells were much briefer (mean of 0.32 ms) than those of the other cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Naundorf et al. fail to explain these features using single- or double-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-style models, suggesting instead that they could arise from cooperative opening of Na+ channels, although there is no direct biological evidence to support this. Here we show that these so-called unique features are to be expected from Hodgkin-Huxley models if the spatial geometry and spike initiation properties of cortical neurons are taken into account--it is therefore unnecessary to invoke exotic channel-gating properties as an explanation.},

@article{Naundorf2006,
abstract = {Neurons process and encode information by generating sequences of action potentials. For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding. Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials--their rapid initiation and variable onset potential--are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.},

@article{Badel2008,
abstract = {The dynamic I-V curve method was recently introduced for the efficient experimental generation of reduced neuron models. The method extracts the response properties of a neuron while it is subject to a naturalistic stimulus that mimics in vivo-like fluctuating synaptic drive. The resulting history-dependent, transmembrane current is then projected onto a one-dimensional current-voltage relation that provides the basis for a tractable non-linear integrate-and-fire model. An attractive feature of the method is that it can be used in spike-triggered mode to quantify the distinct patterns of post-spike refractoriness seen in different classes of cortical neuron. The method is first illustrated using a conductance-based model and is then applied experimentally to generate reduced models of cortical layer-5 pyramidal cells and interneurons, in injected-current and injected- conductance protocols. The resulting low-dimensional neuron models-of the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire type-provide highly accurate predictions for spike-times. The method therefore provides a useful tool for the construction of tractable models and rapid experimental classification of cortical neurons.},

@article{Vreeswijk1996,
abstract = {Neurons in the cortex of behaving animals show temporally irregular spiking patterns. The origin of this irregularity and its implications for neural processing are unknown. The hypothesis that the temporal variability in the firing of a neuron results from an approximate balance between its excitatory and inhibitory inputs was investigated theoretically. Such a balance emerges naturally in large networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations that are sparsely connected by relatively strong synapses. The resulting state is characterized by strongly chaotic dynamics, even when the external inputs to the network are constant in time. Such a network exhibits a linear response, despite the highly nonlinear dynamics of single neurons, and reacts to changing external stimuli on time scales much smaller than the integration time constant of a single neuron.},

@article{Destexhe1999,
abstract = {During wakefulness, neocortical neurons are subjected to an intense synaptic bombardment. To assess the consequences of this background activity for the integrative properties of pyramidal neurons, we constrained biophysical models with in vivo intracellular data obtained in anesthetized cats during periods of intense network activity similar to that observed in the waking state. In pyramidal cells of the parietal cortex (area 5-7), synaptic activity was responsible for an approximately fivefold decrease in input resistance (Rin), a more depolarized membrane potential (Vm), and a marked increase in the amplitude of Vm fluctuations, as determined by comparing the same cells before and after microperfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The model was constrained by measurements of Rin, by the average value and standard deviation of the Vm measured from epochs of intense synaptic activity recorded with KAc or KCl-filled pipettes as well as the values measured in the same cells after TTX. To reproduce all experimental results, the simulated synaptic activity had to be of relatively high frequency (1-5 Hz) at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In addition, synaptic inputs had to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.1) to reproduce the amplitude of Vm fluctuations recorded experimentally. The presence of voltage-dependent K+ currents, estimated from current-voltage relations after TTX, affected these parameters by <10\%. The model predicts that the conductance due to synaptic activity is 7-30 times larger than the somatic leak conductance to be consistent with the approximately fivefold change in Rin. The impact of this massive increase in conductance on dendritic attenuation was investigated for passive neurons and neurons with voltage-dependent Na+/K+ currents in soma and dendrites. In passive neurons, correlated synaptic bombardment had a major influence on dendritic attenuation. The electrotonic attenuation of simulated synaptic inputs was enhanced greatly in the presence of synaptic bombardment, with distal synapses having minimal effects at the soma. Similarly, in the presence of dendritic voltage-dependent currents, the convergence of hundreds of synaptic inputs was required to evoke action potentials reliably. In this case, however, dendritic voltage-dependent currents minimized the variability due to input location, with distal apical synapses being as effective as synapses on basal dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of intracellular and computational data suggests that, during low-amplitude fast electroencephalographic activity, neocortical neurons are bombarded continuously by correlated synaptic inputs at high frequency, which significantly affect their integrative properties. A series of predictions are suggested to test this model.},
