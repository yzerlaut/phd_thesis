abstract = {The connectivity diagram of neocortical circuits is still unknown, and there are conflicting data as to whether cortical neurons are wired specifically or not. To investigate the basic structure of cortical microcircuits, we use a two-photon photostimulation technique that enables the systematic mapping of synaptic connections with single-cell resolution. We map the inhibitory connectivity between upper layers somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells in mouse frontal cortex. Most, and sometimes all, inhibitory neurons are locally connected to every sampled pyramidal cell. This dense inhibitory connectivity is found at both young and mature developmental ages. Inhibitory innervation of neighboring pyramidal cells is similar, regardless of whether they are connected among themselves or not. We conclude that local inhibitory connectivity is promiscuous, does not form subnetworks, and can approach the theoretical limit of a completely connected synaptic matrix. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The distribution of in vivo average firing rates within local cortical networks has been reported to be highly skewed and long tailed. The distribution of average single-cell inputs, conversely, is expected to be Gaussian by the central limit theorem. This raises the issue of how a skewed distribution of firing rates might result from a symmetric distribution of inputs. We argue that skewed rate distributions are a signature of the nonlinearity of the in vivo f-I curve. During in vivo conditions, ongoing synaptic activity produces significant fluctuations in the membrane potential of neurons, resulting in an expansive nonlinearity of the f-I curve for low and moderate inputs. Here, we investigate the effects of single-cell and network parameters on the shape of the f-I curve and, by extension, on the distribution of firing rates in randomly connected networks.},

abstract = {Neurons spike when their membrane potential exceeds a threshold value. In central neurons, the spike threshold is not constant but depends on the stimulation. Thus, input-output properties of neurons depend both on the effect of presynaptic spikes on the membrane potential and on the dynamics of the spike threshold. Among the possible mechanisms that may modulate the threshold, one strong candidate is Na channel inactivation, because it specifically impacts spike initiation without affecting the membrane potential. We collected voltage-clamp data from the literature and we found, based on a theoretical criterion, that the properties of Na inactivation could indeed cause substantial threshold variability by itself. By analyzing simple neuron models with fast Na inactivation (one channel subtype), we found that the spike threshold is correlated with the mean membrane potential and negatively correlated with the preceding depolarization slope, consistent with experiments. We then analyzed the impact of threshold dynamics on synaptic integration. The difference between the postsynaptic potential (PSP) and the dynamic threshold in response to a presynaptic spike defines an effective PSP. When the neuron is sufficiently depolarized, this effective PSP is briefer than the PSP. This mechanism regulates the temporal window of synaptic integration in an adaptive way. Finally, we discuss the role of other potential mechanisms. Distal spike initiation, channel noise and Na activation dynamics cannot account for the observed negative slope-threshold relationship, while adaptive conductances (e.g. K+) and Na inactivation can. We conclude that Na inactivation is a metabolically efficient mechanism to control the temporal resolution of synaptic integration.},

abstract = {We introduce a two-dimensional integrate-and-fire model that combines an exponential spike mechanism with an adaptation equation, based on recent theoretical findings. We describe a systematic method to estimate its parameters with simple electrophysiological protocols (current-clamp injection of pulses and ramps) and apply it to a detailed conductance-based model of a regular spiking neuron. Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96{\%} of the spikes (+/-2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.},

abstract = {In central neurons, the threshold for spike initiation can depend on the stimulus and varies between cells and between recording sites in a given cell, but it is unclear what mechanisms underlie this variability. Properties of ionic channels are likely to play a role in threshold modulation. We examined in models the influence of Na channel activation, inactivation, slow voltage-gated channels and synaptic conductances on spike threshold. We propose a threshold equation which quantifies the contribution of all these mechanisms. It provides an instantaneous time-varying value of the threshold, which applies to neurons with fluctuating inputs. We deduce a differential equation for the threshold, similar to the equations of gating variables in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, which describes how the spike threshold varies with the membrane potential, depending on channel properties. We find that spike threshold depends logarithmically on Na channel density, and that Na channel inactivation and K channels can dynamically modulate it in an adaptive way: the threshold increases with membrane potential and after every action potential. Our equation was validated with simulations of a previously published multicompartemental model of spike initiation. Finally, we observed that threshold variability in models depends crucially on the shape of the Na activation function near spike initiation (about -55 mV), while its parameters are adjusted near half-activation voltage (about -30 mV), which might explain why many models exhibit little threshold variability, contrary to experimental observations. We conclude that ionic channels can account for large variations in spike threshold.},

abstract = {Intracellular recordings of neuronal membrane potential are a central tool in neurophysiology. In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional limitation of such recordings is the high electrode resistance and capacitance, which may cause significant measurement errors during current injection. We introduce a computer-aided technique, Active Electrode Compensation (AEC), based on a digital model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. The characteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current injection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and the recording is then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution. Tests performed in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that AEC enables high-frequency recordings in demanding conditions, such as injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not feasible with a single high-resistance electrode until now. AEC should be particularly useful to characterize fast neuronal phenomena intracellularly in vivo.},

abstract = {Neurons communicate primarily with spikes, but most theories of neural computation are based on firing rates. Yet, many experimental observations suggest that the temporal coordination of spikes plays a role in sensory processing. Among potential spike-based codes, synchrony appears as a good candidate because neural firing and plasticity are sensitive to fine input correlations. However, it is unclear what role synchrony may play in neural computation, and what functional advantage it may provide. With a theoretical approach, I show that the computational interest of neural synchrony appears when neurons have heterogeneous properties. In this context, the relationship between stimuli and neural synchrony is captured by the concept of synchrony receptive field, the set of stimuli which induce synchronous responses in a group of neurons. In a heterogeneous neural population, it appears that synchrony patterns represent structure or sensory invariants in stimuli, which can then be detected by postsynaptic neurons. The required neural circuitry can spontaneously emerge with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Using examples in different sensory modalities, I show that this allows simple neural circuits to extract relevant information from realistic sensory stimuli, for example to identify a fluctuating odor in the presence of distractors. This theory of synchrony-based computation shows that relative spike timing may indeed have computational relevance, and suggests new types of neural network models for sensory processing with appealing computational properties.},

abstract = {In cortical neurons, spikes are initiated in the axon initial segment. Seen at the soma, they appear surprisingly sharp. A standard explanation is that the current coming from the axon becomes sharp as the spike is actively backpropagated to the soma. However, sharp initiation of spikes is also seen in the input-output properties of neurons, and not only in the somatic shape of spikes; for example, cortical neurons can transmit high frequency signals. An alternative hypothesis is that Na channels cooperate, but it is not currently supported by direct experimental evidence. I propose a simple explanation based on the compartmentalization of spike initiation. When Na channels are placed in the axon, the soma acts as a current sink for the Na current. I show that there is a critical distance to the soma above which an instability occurs, so that Na channels open abruptly rather than gradually as a function of somatic voltage.},

abstract = {Multichannel tetrode array recording in awake behaving animals provides a powerful method to record the activity of large numbers of neurons. The power of this method could be extended if further information concerning the intracellular state of the neurons could be extracted from the extracellularly recorded signals. Toward this end, we have simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular signals from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the anesthetized rat. We found that several intracellular parameters can be deduced from extracellular spike waveforms. The width of the intracellular action potential is defined precisely by distinct points on the extracellular spike. Amplitude changes of the intracellular action potential are reflected by changes in the amplitude of the initial negative phase of the extracellular spike, and these amplitude changes are dependent on the state of the network. In addition, intracellular recordings from dendrites with simultaneous extracellular recordings from the soma indicate that, on average, action potentials are initiated in the perisomatic region and propagate to the dendrites at 1.68 m/s. Finally we determined that a tetrode in hippocampal area CA1 theoretically should be able to record electrical signals from approximately 1, 000 neurons. Of these, 60-100 neurons should generate spikes of sufficient amplitude to be detectable from the noise and to allow for their separation using current spatial clustering methods. This theoretical maximum is in contrast to the approximately six units that are usually detected per tetrode. From this, we conclude that a large percentage of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are silent in any given behavioral condition.},

In vitro electrical recordings from these neurons have revealed a correspondingly diverse range of intrinsic firing patterns, including non-adapting, adapting and bursting types. This heterogeneity of electrical responsivity has generally been attributed to variability in the types and densities of ionic channels. We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

abstract = {Models of networks of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons (LIF) are a
widely used tool for theoretical investigations of brain function.
These models have been used both with current- and conductance-based
synapses. However, the differences in the dynamics expressed by these
two approaches have been so far mainly studied at the single neuron
level. To investigate how these synaptic models affect network activity,
we compared the single-neuron and neural population dynamics of conductance-based
networks (COBN) and current-based networks (CUBN) of LIF neurons.
These networks were endowed with sparse excitatory and inhibitory
recurrent connections, and were tested in conditions including both
low- and high-conductance states. We developed a novel procedure
to obtain comparable networks by properly tuning the synaptic parameters
not shared by the models. The so defined comparable networks displayed
an excellent and robust match of first order statistics (average
single neuron firing rates and average frequency spectrum of network
activity). However, these comparable networks showed profound differences
in the second order statistics of neural population interactions
and in the modulation of these properties by external inputs. The
correlation between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents and
the cross-neuron correlation between synaptic inputs, membrane potentials
and spike trains were stronger and more stimulus-sensitive in the
COBN. Because of these properties, the spike train correlation carried
more information about the strength of the input in the COBN, although
the firing rates were equally informative in both network models.
Moreover, COBN showed stronger neuronal population synchronization
in the gamma band, and their spectral information about the network
input was higher and spread over a broader range of frequencies.
These results suggest that second order properties of network dynamics
depend strongly on the choice of synaptic model.},

abstract = {Detailed analysis of neuronal network architecture requires the development of new methods. Here we present strategies to visualize synaptic circuits by genetically labelling neurons with multiple, distinct colours. In Brainbow transgenes, Cre/lox recombination is used to create a stochastic choice of expression between three or more fluorescent proteins (XFPs). Integration of tandem Brainbow copies in transgenic mice yielded combinatorial XFP expression, and thus many colours, thereby providing a way to distinguish adjacent neurons and visualize other cellular interactions. As a demonstration, we reconstructed hundreds of neighbouring axons and multiple synaptic contacts in one small volume of a cerebellar lobe exhibiting approximately 90 colours. The expression in some lines also allowed us to map glial territories and follow glial cells and neurons over time in vivo. The ability of the Brainbow system to label uniquely many individual cells within a population may facilitate the analysis of neuronal circuitry on a large scale.},

abstract = {The thalamus provides fundamental input to the neocortex. This input activates inhibitory interneurons more strongly than excitatory neurons, triggering powerful feedforward inhibition. We studied the mechanisms of this selective neuronal activation using a mouse somatosensory thalamocortical preparation. Notably, the greater responsiveness of inhibitory interneurons was not caused by their distinctive intrinsic properties but was instead produced by synaptic mechanisms. Axons from the thalamus made stronger and more frequent excitatory connections onto inhibitory interneurons than onto excitatory cells. Furthermore, circuit dynamics allowed feedforward inhibition to suppress responses in excitatory cells more effectively than in interneurons. Thalamocortical excitatory currents rose quickly in interneurons, allowing them to fire action potentials before significant feedforward inhibition emerged. In contrast, thalamocortical excitatory currents rose slowly in excitatory cells, overlapping with feedforward inhibitory currents that suppress action potentials. These results demonstrate the importance of selective synaptic targeting and precise timing in the initial stages of neocortical processing.},

High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

abstract = {The integrate-and-fire neuron model is one of the most widely used models for analyzing the behavior of neural systems. It describes the membrane potential of a neuron in terms of the synaptic inputs and the injected current that it receives. An action potential (spike) is generated when the membrane potential reaches a threshold, but the actual changes associated with the membrane voltage and conductances driving the action potential do not form part of the model. The synaptic inputs to the neuron are considered to be stochastic and are described as a temporally homogeneous Poisson process. Methods and results for both current synapses and conductance synapses are examined in the diffusion approximation, where the individual contributions to the postsynaptic potential are small. The focus of this review is upon the mathematical techniques that give the time distribution of output spikes, namely stochastic differential equations and the Fokker-Planck equation. The integrate-and-fire neuron model has become established as a canonical model for the description of spiking neurons because it is capable of being analyzed mathematically while at the same time being sufficiently complex to capture many of the essential features of neural processing. A number of variations of the model are discussed, together with the relationship with the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model and the comparison with electrophysiological data. A brief overview is given of two issues in neural information processing that the integrate-and-fire neuron model has contributed to - the irregular nature of spiking in cortical neurons and neural gain modulation.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex exhibit several nonlinearities in their responses to visual stimuli, including response decrements to repeated stimuli, contrast-dependent phase advance, contrast saturation, and cross-orientation suppression. Thalamocortical synaptic depression has been implicated in these phenomena but has not been examined directly in visual cortex in vivo. We assessed depression of visual thalamocortical synapses in vivo using 20-100 Hz trains of electrical stimuli delivered to the LGN. Cortical cells receiving direct input from the LGN, identified by short latency and low jitter of LGN-evoked PSPs, showed moderate reductions in PSP amplitude during the fastest trains. Cells receiving indirect input from the thalamus via other cortical excitatory neurons show a marked reduction in PSP amplitude during a train, which could be explained either by synaptic depression in corticocortical synapses or by an inhibition-mediated suppression of the firing of their afferents. Reducing spontaneous activity in the LGN (by retinal blockade) unmasked additional depression at the thalamocortical synapse but only for the first stimulus in the train. That is, the first PSP was increased in amplitude relative to the unblocked condition, but subsequent responses were essentially unchanged. Thus, the synapses are maintained at significant levels of depression by spontaneous activity. These findings constrain the role that thalamocortical depression can play in shaping cortical responses to visual stimuli.},

abstract = {A theoretical analysis was undertaken of a Rall motoneuron under voltage clamp with a finite access resistance. This model is relevant to the conditions of the whole-cell patch clamp, which to date has been used very little for cable analysis. It was shown that the soma and cable charging currents can be distinguished, and that the soma is charged with a time constant approximately equal to the access resistance times the somatic capacitance. Thus, the charging time of the soma is similar to what it would be if the cell had no process. Simple formulas were derived that can be used to calculate the electrotonic length, the membrane time constant, and the soma-dendrite resistance ratio of a cell with a cylindrical process. With the aid of these formulas, reasonable estimates of parameter values were recovered from simulated transient currents. Tests of the Rall model were proposed to determine when there is an equivalent cylinder that is consistent with observed charging behavior. The analysis was extended to a cable with an open end and to a model in which the soma and dendrite have different membrane time constants. It was shown that with voltage-clamp data estimates of electrical parameters other than rho are relatively insensitive to differences between the membrane properties of the soma and dendrite. The methods of cable analysis introduced here were illustrated by application to charging transients recorded from a hippocampal pyramidal cell and from a neurohypophysial nerve ending. The Rall model provided a good description of the pyramidal cell current transient but was inconsistent with the charging behavior observed for the nerve ending. With the recent technical advance of patch clamp recording in brain slices, the analysis presented here should help neurophysiologists investigate cable properties in a wide variety of systems.},

abstract = {Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes (SPW-Rs) occur during slow-wave sleep and behavioral immobility and are thought to represent stored information that is transferred to the neocortex during memory consolidation. Here we show that stimuli that induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a neurophysiological correlate of learning and memory, can lead to the generation of SPW-Rs in rat hippocampal slices. The induced SPW-Rs have properties that are identical to spontaneously generated SPW-Rs: they originate in CA3, propagate to CA1 and subiculum and require AMPA/kainate receptors. Their induction is dependent on NMDA receptors and involves changes in interactions between clusters of neurons in the CA3 network. Their expression is blocked by low-frequency stimulation but not by NMDA receptor antagonists. These data indicate that induction of LTP in the recurrent CA3 network may facilitate the generation of SPW-Rs.},

@article{Azouz1999,
abstract = {Cortical neurons recorded in vivo exhibit highly variable responses to the repeated presentation of the same stimulus. To further understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed intracellular recordings from neurons in cat striate cortex in vivo and examined the relationships between spontaneous activity and visually evoked responses. Activity was assessed on a trial-by-trial basis by measuring the membrane potential (Vm) fluctuations and spike activity during brief epochs immediately before and after the onset of an evoked response. We found that the response magnitude, expressed as a change in Vm relative to baseline, was linearly correlated with the preceding spontaneous Vm. This correlation was enhanced when the cells were hyperpolarized to reduce the activation of voltage-gated conductances. The output of the cells, expressed as spike counts and latencies, was only moderately correlated with fluctuations in the preceding spontaneous Vm. Spike-triggered averaging of Vm revealed that visually evoked action potentials arise from transient depolarizations having a rise time of approximately 10 msec. Consistent with this, evoked spike count was found to be linearly correlated with the magnitude of Vm fluctuations in the gamma (20-70 Hz) frequency band. We also found that the threshold of visually evoked action potentials varied over a range of approximately 10 mV. Examination of simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular activity revealed a correlation between Vm depolarization and spike discharges in adjacent cells. Together these results demonstrate that response variability is attributable largely to coherent fluctuations in cortical activity preceding the onset of a stimulus, but also to variations in action potential threshold and the magnitude of high-frequency fluctuations evoked by the stimulus.},

abstract = {The slow ({\textless}1 Hz) oscillation, with its alternating 'up' and 'down' states in individual neurons, is a defining feature of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Although this oscillation is well preserved across mammalian species, its physiological role is unclear. Electrophysiological and computational evidence from the cortex and thalamus now indicates that slow-oscillation 'up' states and the 'activated' state of wakefulness are remarkably similar dynamic entities. This is consistent with behavioural experiments suggesting that slow-oscillation 'up' states provide a context for the replay, and possible consolidation, of previous experience. In this scenario, the T-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent bursts of action potentials that initiate each 'up' state in thalamocortical (TC) neurons might function as triggers for synaptic and cellular plasticity in corticothalamic networks. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).},

@article{Meyer2010,
abstract = {This is the concluding article in a series of 3 studies that investigate the anatomical determinants of thalamocortical (TC) input to excitatory neurons in a cortical column of rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We used viral synaptophysin-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in thalamic neurons and reconstructions of biocytin-labeled cortical neurons in TC slices to quantify the number and distribution of boutons from the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and posteromedial (POm) nuclei potentially innervating dendritic arbors of excitatory neurons located in layers (L)2-6 of a cortical column in rat somatosensory cortex. We found that 1) all types of excitatory neurons potentially receive substantial TC input (90-580 boutons per neuron); 2) pyramidal neurons in L3-L6 receive dual TC input from both VPM and POm that is potentially of equal magnitude for thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons (ca. 300 boutons each from VPM and POm); 3) L3, L4, and L5 pyramidal neurons have multiple (2-4) subcellular TC innervation domains that match the dendritic compartments of pyramidal cells; and 4) a subtype of thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons has an additional VPM innervation domain in L4. The multiple subcellular TC innervation domains of L5 pyramidal neurons may partly explain their specific action potential patterns observed in vivo. We conclude that the substantial potential TC innervation of all excitatory neuron types in a cortical column constitutes an anatomical basis for the initial near-simultaneous representation of a sensory stimulus in different neuron types.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical (TC) synapses carry information into the neocortex, but they are far outnumbered by excitatory intracortical (IC) synapses. We measured the synaptic properties that determine the efficacy of TC and IC axons converging onto spiny neurons of layer 4 in the mouse somatosensory cortex. Quantal events from TC and IC synapses were indistinguishable. However, TC axons had, on average, about 3 times more release sites than IC axons, and the mean release probability at TC synapses was about 1.5 times higher than that at IC synapses. Differences of innervation ratio and release probability make the average TC connection several times more effective than the average IC connection, and may allow small numbers of TC axons to dominate the activity of cortical layer 4 cells during sensory inflow.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {The propagation of activity in neural tissue is generally associated with synaptic transmission, but epileptiform activity in the hippocampus can propagate with or without synaptic transmission at a speed of ∼0.1 m/s. This suggests an underlying common nonsynaptic mechanism for propagation. To study this mechanism, we developed a novel unfolded hippocampus preparation, from CD1 mice of either sex, which preserves the transverse and longitudinal connections and recorded activity with a penetrating microelectrode array. Experiments using synaptic transmission and gap junction blockers indicated that longitudinal propagation is independent of chemical or electrical synaptic transmission. Propagation speeds of 0.1 m/s are not compatible with ionic diffusion or pure axonal conduction. The only other means of communication between neurons is through electric fields. Computer simulations revealed that activity can indeed propagate from cell to cell solely through field effects. These results point to an unexpected propagation mechanism for neural activity in the hippocampus involving endogenous field effect transmission.},

@article{Taylor2012,
abstract = {Capacitance is a fundamental neuronal property. One common way to measure capacitance is to deliver a small voltage-clamp step that is long enough for the clamp current to come to steady state, and then to divide the integrated transient charge by the voltage-clamp step size. In an isopotential neuron, this method is known to measure the total cell capacitance. However, in a cell that is not isopotential, this measures only a fraction of the total capacitance. This has generally been thought of as measuring the capacitance of the "well-clamped" part of the membrane, but the exact meaning of this has been unclear. Here, we show that the capacitance measured in this way is a weighted sum of the total capacitance, where the weight for a given small patch of membrane is determined by the voltage deflection at that patch, as a fraction of the voltage-clamp step size. This quantifies precisely what it means to measure the capacitance of the "well-clamped" part of the neuron. Furthermore, it reveals that the voltage-clamp step method measures a well-defined quantity, one that may be more useful than the total cell capacitance for normalizing conductances measured in voltage-clamp in nonisopotential cells.},

abstract = {Fluctuation analysis of synaptic transmission using the variance-mean approach has been restricted in the past to steady-state responses. Here we extend this method to short repetitive trains of synaptic responses, during which the response amplitudes are not stationary. We consider intervals between trains, long enough so that the system is in the same average state at the beginning of each train. This allows analysis of ensemble means and variances for each response in a train separately. Thus, modifications in synaptic efficacy during short-term plasticity can be attributed to changes in synaptic parameters. In addition, we provide practical guidelines for the analysis of the covariance between successive responses in trains. Explicit algorithms to estimate synaptic parameters are derived and tested by Monte Carlo simulations on the basis of a binomial model of synaptic transmission, allowing for quantal variability, heterogeneity in the release probability, and postsynaptic receptor saturation and desensitization. We find that the combined analysis of variance and covariance is advantageous in yielding an estimate for the number of release sites, which is independent of heterogeneity in the release probability under certain conditions. Furthermore, it allows one to calculate the apparent quantal size for each response in a sequence of stimuli.},

Results show that the rate of rise of the transmembrane potential was more rapid than the step response of a space-clamped membrane for all geometries considered. The response of the cylindrical fiber to extracellular stimulation is compared to previously reported studies of the cylindrical fiber response to intracellular stimulation. It is found that the location of the stimulus has little effect on the infinite fiber response. For terminated cables, however, an accurate model of stimulus response must discriminate between intracellular and extracellular stimulation.},

abstract = {Neurons in sensory systems respond to stimuli within their receptive fields, but the magnitude of the response depends on specific stimulus features. In the rodent whisker system, the response magnitude to the deflection of a particular whisker is, in most cells, dependent on the direction of deflection. Here we use in vivo intracellular recordings from thalamorecipient neurons in layers 3 and 4 of the rat barrel cortex to elucidate the dynamics of the synaptic inputs underlying direction selectivity. We show that cells are direction selective despite a broadly tuned excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Selectivity emerges from a direction-dependent temporal shift of excitation relative to inhibition. For preferred direction deflections, excitation precedes inhibition, but as the direction diverges from the preferred, this separation decreases. Our results illustrate a mechanism by which the timing of the synaptic inputs, and not their relative peak amplitudes, primarily determine feature selectivity.},

abstract = {Randomly-connected networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are known to display asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the discharge activity recorded in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. However, it is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models, or if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex intrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we investigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons, such as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This model can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS), regular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the oscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks using such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with surprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show that the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust emergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks with strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is reduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical networks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but with strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state transitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by two-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic properties such as adaptation and low-threshold bursting activity are crucial for the genesis and control of AI states in thalamocortical networks.},

@article{Steriade2001,
abstract = {Data from in vivo and in vitro experiments are discussed to emphasize that synaptic activities in neocortex and thalamus have a decisive impact on intrinsic neuronal properties in intact-brain preparations under anesthesia and even more so during natural states of vigilance. Thus the firing patterns of cortical neuronal types are not inflexible but may change with the level of membrane potential and during periods rich in synaptic activity. The incidences of some cortical cell classes (defined by their responses to depolarizing current pulses) are different in isolated cortical slabs in vivo or in slices maintained in vitro compared with the intact cortex of naturally awake animals. Network activities, which include the actions of generalized modulatory systems, have a profound influence on the membrane potential, apparent input resistance, and backpropagation of action potentials. The analysis of various oscillatory types leads to the conclusion that in the intact brain, there are no "pure" rhythms, generated in simple circuits, but complex wave sequences (consisting of different, low- and fast-frequency oscillations) that result from synaptic interactions in corticocortical and corticothalamic neuronal loops under the control of activating systems arising in the brain stem core or forebrain structures. As an illustration, it is shown that the neocortex governs the synchronization of network or intrinsically generated oscillations in the thalamus. The rhythmic recurrence of spike bursts and spike trains fired by thalamic and cortical neurons during states of decreased vigilance may lead to plasticity processes in neocortical neurons. If these phenomena, which may contribute to the consolidation of memory traces, are not constrained by inhibitory processes, they induce seizures in which the neocortex initiates the paroxysms and controls their thalamic reflection. The results indicate that intact-brain preparations are necessary to investigate global brain functions such as behavioral states of vigilance and paroxysmal activities.},

abstract = {Sharp wave bursts, induced by a cooperative discharge of CA3 pyramidal cells, are the most synchronous physiological pattern in the hippocampus. In conjunction with sharp wave bursts, CA1 pyramidal cells display a high-frequency (200 Hz) network oscillation (ripple). In the present study extracellular field and unit activity was recorded simultaneously from 16 closely spaces sites in the awake rat and the intracellular activity of CA1 pyramidal cells during the network oscillation was studied under anesthesia. Current source density analysis of the high-frequency oscillation revealed circumscribed sinks and sources in the vicinity of the pyramidal layer. Single pyramidal cells discharged at a low frequency but were phase locked to the negative peak of the locally derived field oscillation. Approximately 10{\%} of the simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells fired during a given oscillatory event. Putative interneurons increased their discharge rates during the field ripples severalfold and often maintained a 200 Hz frequency during the oscillatory event. Under urethane and ketamine anesthesia the frequency of ripples was slower (100-120 Hz) than in the awake rat (180-200 Hz). Halothane anesthesia prevented the occurrence of high-frequency field oscillations in the CA1 region. Both the amplitude (1-4 mV) and phase of the intracellular ripple, but not its frequency, were voltage dependent. The amplitude of intracellular ripple was smallest between -70 and -80 mV. The phase of intracellular oscillation relative to the extracellular ripple reversed when the membrane was hyperpolarized more than -80 mV. A histologically verified CA1 basket cell increased its firing rate during the network oscillation and discharged at the frequency of the extracellular ripple. These findings indicate that the intracellularly recorded fast oscillatory rhythm is not solely dependent on membrane currents intrinsic to the CA1 pyramidal cells but it is a network driven phenomenon dependent upon the participation of inhibitory interneurons. We hypothesize that fast field oscillation (200 Hz) in the CA1 region reflects summed IPSPs in pyramidal cells as a result of high-frequency barrage of interneurons. The sharp wave associated synchronous discharge of pyramidal cells in the millisecond range can exert a powerful influence on retrohippocampal targets and may facilitate the transfer of transiently stored memory traces from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex.},

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons are characterized by their distinct apical and basal dendritic trees and the pyramidal shape of their soma. They are found in several regions of the CNS and, although the reasons for their abundance remain unclear, functional studies--especially of CA1 hippocampal and layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons--have offered insights into the functions of their unique cellular architecture. Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some shared functional principles can be identified. In particular, the existence of dendritic domains with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity appears to be a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to contribute to action-potential generation. These properties support a variety of coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity.},

abstract = {Hodgkin and Huxley provided the first quantitative description of voltage-dependent currents and adjusted their model to experimental data using empirical functions of voltage. A physically plausible formalism was proposed later by assuming that transition rates depend exponentially on a free-energy barrier, by analogy with the theory of reaction rates. It was also assumed that the free energy depends linearly on voltage. This thermodynamic formalism can accurately describe many processes, but the resulting time constants can be arbitrarily fast, which may also lead to aberrant behavior. We considered here a physically plausible solution to this problem by including nonlinear effects of the electrical field on the free energy. We show that including effects such as mechanical constraints, inherent to the structure of the ion channel protein, leads to more accurate thermodynamic models. These models can account for voltage-dependent transitions that are rate-limited in a given voltage range, without invoking additional states. We illustrate their applicability to fit experimental data by considering the case of the T-type calcium current in thalamic neurons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the various hippocampal network patterns, sharp wave-ripples (SPW-R) are currently the mechanistically least understood. Although accurate information on synaptic interactions between the participating neurons is essential for comprehensive understanding of the network function during complex activities like SPW-R, such knowledge is currently notably scarce.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate an in vitro approach to SPW-R that offers a simple experimental tool allowing detailed analysis of mechanisms governing the sharp wave-state of the hippocampus. We combine interface storage of slices with modifications of a conventional submerged recording system and established in vitro SPW-R comparable to their in vivo counterpart. We show that slice storage in the interface chamber close to physiological temperature is the required condition to preserve network integrity that is necessary for the generation of SPW-R. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our method for studying synaptic and network properties of SPW-R, using electrophysiological and imaging methods that can only be applied in the submerged system.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The approach presented here demonstrates a reliable and experimentally simple strategy for studying hippocampal sharp wave-ripples. Given its utility and easy application we expect our model to foster the generation of new insight into the network physiology underlying SPW-R.},

@article{Ho2000,
abstract = {Neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo are subject to an intense synaptic background activity but little is known of how this activity affects cellular responsiveness and what function it may serve. These issues were examined in morphologically reconstructed neocortical pyramidal neurons in which synaptic background activity was simulated based on recent measurements in cat parietal cortex. We show that background activity can be decomposed into two components: a tonically active conductance and voltage fluctuations. Previous studies have mostly focused on the conductance effect, revealing that background activity is responsible for a decrease in responsiveness, which imposes severe conditions of coincidence of inputs necessary to discharge the cell. It is shown here, in contrast, that responsiveness is enhanced if voltage fluctuations are taken into account; in this case the model can produce responses to inputs that would normally be subthreshold. This effect is analyzed by dissecting and comparing the different components of background activity, as well as by evaluating the contribution of parameters such as the dendritic morphology, the distribution of leak currents, the value of axial resistivity, the densities of voltage-dependent currents, and the release parameters underlying background activity. Interestingly, the model's optimal responsiveness was obtained when voltage fluctuations were of the same order as those measured intracellularly in vivo. Possible consequences were also investigated at the population level, where the presence of background activity allowed networks of pyramidal neurons to instantaneously detect inputs that are small compared with the classical detection threshold. These results suggest, at the single-cell level, that the presence of voltage fluctuations has a determining influence on cellular responsiveness and that these should be taken into account in models of background activity. At the network level, we predict that background activity provides the necessary drive for detecting events that would normally be undetectable. Experiments are suggested to explore this possible functional role for background activity.},

@article{Mazzoni2010,
abstract = {Despite the widespread use of EEGs to measure the large-scale dynamics of the human brain, little is known on how the dynamics of EEGs relates to that of the underlying spike rates of cortical neurons. However, progress was made by recent neurophysiological experiments reporting that EEG delta-band phase and gamma-band amplitude reliably predict some complementary aspects of the time course of spikes of visual cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, here we hypothesize that the EEG delta phase reflects shifts of local cortical excitability arising from slow fluctuations in the network input due to entrainment to sensory stimuli or to fluctuations in ongoing activity, and that the resulting local excitability fluctuations modulate both the spike rate and the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops producing gamma-band oscillations. We quantitatively tested these hypotheses by simulating a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons stimulated with dynamic inputs presenting temporal regularities similar to that of thalamic responses during naturalistic visual stimulation and during spontaneous activity. The network model reproduced in detail the experimental relationships between spike rate and EEGs, and suggested that the complementariness of the prediction of spike rates obtained from EEG delta phase or gamma amplitude arises from nonlinearities in the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops and from temporal modulations in the amplitude of the network input, which respectively limit the predictability of spike rates from gamma amplitude or delta phase alone. The model suggested also ways to improve and extend current algorithms for online prediction of spike rates from EEGs.},

abstract = {Homeostatic mechanisms maintain homogeneous neuronal behavior among neurons that exhibit substantial variability in the expression levels of their ionic conductances. In contrast, the mechanisms, which generate heterogeneous neuronal behavior across a neuronal population, remain poorly understood. We addressed this problem in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, where principal neurons exist in two qualitatively distinct states: spontaneously active or not spontaneously active. Our studies reveal that distinct activity states are generated by the differential levels of a Ba(2+)-sensitive, inwardly rectifying potassium conductance (K(ir)). Variability in K(ir) maximal conductance causes variations in the resting membrane potential (RMP). Low K(ir) conductance depolarizes RMP to voltages above the threshold for activating subthreshold-persistent sodium channels (Na(p)). Once Na(p) channels are activated, the RMP becomes unstable, and spontaneous firing is triggered. Our results provide a biophysical mechanism for generating neural heterogeneity, which may play a role in the encoding of sensory information.},

We ask whether constraining a model to fit the EAP is superior to matching the intracellular action potential (IAP). In agreement with previous studies, we find that the IAP method under-constrains the parameters. As a result, significantly different sets of parameters can have virtually identical IAP's. In contrast, the EAP method results in a much tighter constraint. We find that the distinguishing characteristics of the waveform--but not its amplitude-resulting from the distribution of active conductances are fairly invariant to changes of electrode position and detailed cellular morphology. Based on these results, we conclude that EAP recordings are an excellent source of data for the purpose of constraining compartmental models.},

The inhibitory effect of the EHP was shown to be comparable in intensity to the effect of the IPSP. Excitability changes in the M cell during collateral IPSP depended on changes in the membrane conductance as well as in the membrane potential. Some simple equations are advanced which describe the excitability change during the IPSP in terms of changes in membrane potential and conductance. It was also found that invasion of antidromic impulses into the M cell was suppressed during the EHP, but not during the collateral IPSP. Conductance increase during the IPSP did not interfere with the invasion of antidromic impulses.},

This study examined whether the variability can be attributed to ongoing activity. Ongoing and evoked spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cat visual cortex were measured with real-time optical imaging; local field potentials and discharges of single neurons were recorded simultaneously, by electrophysiological techniques. The evoked activity appeared deterministic, and the variability resulted from the dynamics of ongoing activity, presumably reflecting the instantaneous state of cortical networks. In spite of the large variability, evoked responses in single trials could be predicted by linear summation of the deterministic response and the preceding ongoing activity. Ongoing activity must play an important role in cortical function and cannot be ignored in exploration of cognitive processes.},

abstract = {The joint influence of recurrent feedback and noise on gain control in a network of globally coupled spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons is studied theoretically and numerically. The context of our work is the origin of divisive versus subtractive gain control, as mixtures of these effects are seen in a variety of experimental systems. We focus on changes in the slope of the mean firing frequency-versus-input bias (f-I) curve when the gain control signal to the cells comes from the cells' output spikes. Feedback spikes are modeled as alpha functions that produce an additive current in the current balance equation. For generality, they occur after a fixed minimum delay. We show that purely divisive gain control, i.e. changes in the slope of the f-I curve, arises naturally with this additive negative or positive feedback, due to a linearizing actions of feedback. Negative feedback alone lowers the gain, accounting in particular for gain changes in weakly electric fish upon pharmacological opening of the feedback loop as reported by Bastian (J Neurosci 6:553-562, 1986). When negative feedback is sufficiently strong it further causes oscillatory firing patterns which produce irregularities in the f-I curve. Small positive feedback alone increases the gain, but larger amounts cause abrupt jumps to higher firing frequencies. On the other hand, noise alone in open loop linearizes the f-I curve around threshold, and produces mixtures of divisive and subtractive gain control. With both noise and feedback, the combined gain control schemes produce a primarily divisive gain control shift, indicating the robustness of feedback gain control in stochastic networks. Similar results are found when the "input" parameter is the contrast of a time-varying signal rather than the bias current. Theoretical results are derived relating the slope of the f-I curve to feedback gain and noise strength. Good agreement with simulation results are found for inhibitory and excitatory feedback. Finally, divisive feedback is also found for conductance-based feedback (shunting or excitatory) with and without noise.},

@article{Tabone2010,
abstract = {Proper pattern organization and reorganization are central problems facing many biological networks which thrive in fluctuating environments. However, in many cases the mechanisms that organize system activity oppose those that support behavioral flexibility. Thus, a balance between pattern organization and pattern flexibility is critically important for overall biological fitness. We study this balance in the foraging strategies of ant colonies exploiting food in dynamic environments. We present discrete time and space simulations of colony activity that uses a pheromone-based recruitment strategy biasing foraging towards a food source. After food relocation, the pheromone must evaporate sufficiently before foraging can shift colony attention to a new food source. The amount of food consumed within the dynamic environment depends non-monotonically on the pheromone evaporation time constant-with maximal consumption occurring at a time constant which balances trail formation and trail flexibility. A deterministic, 'mean field' model of pheromone and foragers on trails mimics our colony simulations. This reduced framework captures the essence of the flexibility-organization balance, and relates optimal pheromone evaporation to the timescale of the dynamic environment.

abstract = {The interplay between inhibition and excitation is at the core of cortical network activity. In many cortices, including auditory cortex (ACx), interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons generate synchronous network gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz). Here, we show that differences in the connection patterns and synaptic properties of excitatory-inhibitory microcircuits permit the spatial extent of network inputs to modulate the magnitude of gamma oscillations. Simultaneous multiple whole-cell recordings from connected fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal cells in L2/3 of mouse ACx slices revealed that for intersomatic distances {\textless}50 microm, most inhibitory connections occurred in reciprocally connected (RC) pairs; at greater distances, inhibitory connections were equally likely in RC and nonreciprocally connected (nRC) pairs. Furthermore, the GABA(B)-mediated inhibition in RC pairs was weaker than in nRC pairs. Simulations with a network model that incorporated these features showed strong, gamma band oscillations only when the network inputs were confined to a small area. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which oscillatory activity can be modulated by adjusting the spatial distribution of afferent input.},

@article{Polk2012,
abstract = {Neural activity that persists long after stimulus presentation is a biological correlate of short-term memory. Variability in spiking activity causes persistent states to drift over time, ultimately degrading memory. Models of short-term memory often assume that the input fluctuations to neural populations are independent across cells, a feature that attenuates population-level variability and stabilizes persistent activity. However, this assumption is at odds with experimental recordings from pairs of cortical neurons showing that both the input currents and output spike trains are correlated. It remains unclear how correlated variability affects the stability of persistent activity and the performance of cognitive tasks that it supports. We consider the stochastic long-timescale attractor dynamics of pairs of mutually inhibitory populations of spiking neurons. In these networks, persistent activity was less variable when correlated variability was globally distributed across both populations compared with the case when correlations were locally distributed only within each population. Using a reduced firing rate model with a continuum of persistent states, we show that, when input fluctuations are correlated across both populations, they drive firing rate fluctuations orthogonal to the persistent state attractor, thereby causing minimal stochastic drift. Using these insights, we establish that distributing correlated fluctuations globally as opposed to locally improves network's performance on a two-interval, delayed response discrimination task. Our work shows that the correlation structure of input fluctuations to a network is an important factor when determining long-timescale, persistent population spiking activity.},

abstract = {Correlated variability of neural spiking activity has important consequences for signal processing. How incoming sensory signals shape correlations of population responses remains unclear. Cross-correlations between spiking of different neurons may be particularly consequential in sparsely firing neural populations such as those found in layer 2/3 of sensory cortex. In rat whisker barrel cortex, we found that pairs of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons exhibit similarly low levels of spike count correlation during both spontaneous and sensory-evoked states. The spontaneous activity of excitatory-inhibitory neuron pairs is positively correlated, while sensory stimuli actively decorrelate joint responses. Computational modeling shows how threshold nonlinearities and local inhibition form the basis of a general decorrelating mechanism. We show that inhibitory population activity maintains low correlations in excitatory populations, especially during periods of sensory-evoked coactivation. The role of feedforward inhibition has been previously described in the context of trial-averaged phenomena. Our findings reveal a novel role for inhibition to shape correlations of neural variability and thereby prevent excessive correlations in the face of feedforward sensory-evoked activation.},

abstract = {Diverse sensory organs, including mammalian taste buds and insect chemosensory sensilla, show a marked compartmentalization of receptor cells; however, the functional impact of this organization remains unclear. Here we show that compartmentalized Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) communicate with each other directly. The sustained response of one ORN is inhibited by the transient activation of a neighbouring ORN. Mechanistically, such lateral inhibition does not depend on synapses and is probably mediated by ephaptic coupling. Moreover, lateral inhibition in the periphery can modulate olfactory behaviour. Together, the results show that integration of olfactory information can occur via lateral interactions between ORNs. Inhibition of a sustained response by a transient response may provide a means of encoding salience. Finally, a CO(2)-sensitive ORN in the malaria mosquito Anopheles can also be inhibited by excitation of an adjacent ORN, suggesting a broad occurrence of lateral inhibition in insects and possible applications in insect control.},

abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje cells produce two distinct forms of action potential output: simple and complex spikes. Simple spikes occur spontaneously or are driven by parallel fibre input, while complex spikes are activated by climbing fibre input. Previous studies indicate that both simple and complex spikes originate in the axon of Purkinje cells, but the precise location where they are initiated is unclear. Here we address where in the axon of cerebellar Purkinje cells simple and complex spikes are generated. Using extracellular recording and voltage-sensitive dye imaging in rat and mouse Purkinje cells, we show that both simple and complex spikes are generated in the proximal axon, 15-20 mum from the soma. Once initiated, simple and complex spikes propagate both down the axon and back into the soma. The speed of backpropagation into the soma was significantly faster for complex compared to simple spikes, presumably due to charging of the somatodendritic membrane capacitance during the climbing fibre synaptic conductance. In conclusion, we show using two independent methods that the final integration site of simple and complex spikes is in the proximal axon of cerebellar Purkinje cells, at a location corresponding to the distal end of the axon initial segment.},

abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje cells display complex intrinsic dynamics. They fire spontaneously, exhibit bistability, and via mutual network interactions are involved in the generation of high frequency oscillations and travelling waves of activity. To probe the dynamical properties of Purkinje cells we measured their phase response curves (PRCs). PRCs quantify the change in spike phase caused by a stimulus as a function of its temporal position within the interspike interval, and are widely used to predict neuronal responses to more complex stimulus patterns. Significant variability in the interspike interval during spontaneous firing can lead to PRCs with a low signal-to-noise ratio, requiring averaging over thousands of trials. We show using electrophysiological experiments and simulations that the PRC calculated in the traditional way by sampling the interspike interval with brief current pulses is biased. We introduce a corrected approach for calculating PRCs which eliminates this bias. Using our new approach, we show that Purkinje cell PRCs change qualitatively depending on the firing frequency of the cell. At high firing rates, Purkinje cells exhibit single-peaked, or monophasic PRCs. Surprisingly, at low firing rates, Purkinje cell PRCs are largely independent of phase, resembling PRCs of ideal non-leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. These results indicate that Purkinje cells can act as perfect integrators at low firing rates, and that the integration mode of Purkinje cells depends on their firing rate.},

After stimulating the ipsilateral eighth cranial nerve, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) appears in the M-cell with a latency which is very brief ( about 0.1 msec) and which proba; bly represents a negligible synaptic delay. This response is attributed to the club endings: there were steep gradients of potential along the lateral dendrite of the M-cell during activity and the early EPSP was maximal in the distal part of the dendrite where the club endings predominate. Potential changes in the M-cell spread (passively) backwards into certain eighth-nerve fibers (probably club endings) indicating the presence of special low-resistance connections between them and the M-cell.},

abstract = {Spontaneous activity within local circuits affects the integrative properties of neurons and networks. We have previously shown that neocortical network activity exhibits a balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials, and such activity has significant effects on synaptic transmission, action potential generation, and spike timing. However, whether such activity facilitates or reduces sensory responses has yet to be clearly determined. We examined this hypothesis in the primary visual cortex in vivo during slow oscillations in ketamine-xylazine anesthetized cats. We measured network activity (Up states) with extracellular recording, while simultaneously recording postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and action potentials in nearby cells. Stimulating the receptive field revealed that spiking responses of both simple and complex cells were significantly enhanced ({\textgreater}2-fold) during network activity, as were spiking responses to intracellular injection of varying amplitude artificial conductance stimuli. Visually evoked PSPs were not significantly different in amplitude during network activity or quiescence; instead, spontaneous depolarization caused by network activity brought these evoked PSPs closer to firing threshold. Further examination revealed that visual responsiveness was gradually enhanced by progressive membrane potential depolarization. These spontaneous depolarizations enhanced responsiveness to stimuli of varying contrasts, resulting in an upward (multiplicative) scaling of the contrast response function. Our results suggest that small increases in ongoing balanced network activity that result in depolarization may provide a rapid and generalized mechanism to control the responsiveness (gain) of cortical neurons, such as occurs during shifts in spatial attention.},

abstract = {A theoretical basis is provided for the estimation of the electrotonic length of a membrane cylinder, or the effective electrotonic length of a whole neuron, from electrophysiological experiments. It depends upon the several time constants present in passive decay of membrane potential from an initially nonuniform distribution over the length. In addition to the well known passive membrane time constant, tau(m) = R(m)C(m), observed in the decay of a uniform membrane potential, there exist many smaller time constants that govern rapid equalization of membrane potential over the length. These time constants are present also in the transient response to a current step applied across the membrane at one location, such as the neuron soma. Similar time constants are derived when a lumped soma is coupled to one or more cylinders representing one or more dendritic trees. Different time constants are derived when a voltage clamp is applied at one location; the effects of both leaky and short-circuited termination are also derived. All of these time constants are demonstrated as consequences of mathematical boundary value problems. These results not only provide a basis for estimating electrotonic length, L = [unk]/lambda, but also provide a new basis for estimating the steady-state ratio, rho, of cylinder input conductance to soma membrane conductance.},

While propagating waves are clearly present under anaesthesia, whether they also appear during awake and conscious states remains unclear. One possibility is that these waves are systematically missed in trial-averaged data, due to variability. Here we present a method for detecting propagating waves in noisy multichannel recordings. Applying this method to single-trial voltage-sensitive dye imaging data, we show that the stimulus-evoked population response in primary visual cortex of the awake monkey propagates as a travelling wave, with consistent dynamics across trials. A network model suggests that this reliability is the hallmark of the horizontal fibre network of superficial cortical layers. Propagating waves with similar properties occur independently in secondary visual cortex, but maintain precise phase relations with the waves in primary visual cortex. These results show that, in response to a visual stimulus, propagating waves are systematically evoked in several visual areas, generating a consistent spatiotemporal frame for further neuronal interactions.},

abstract = {Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense subthreshold membrane potential (V(m)) activity. The power spectral density of the V(m) displays a power-law structure at high frequencies ({\textgreater}50 Hz) with a slope of approximately -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is short-circuited by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which may not be realistic. Here, we integrate nonideal capacitors in cable equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged instantaneously. We show that the resulting nonideal cable model can be solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using nonideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of high frequencies, which is boosted in nonideal cables, or voltage attenuation in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on nonideal capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high frequencies.},

abstract = {We describe a phenomenon of hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity (HAGPA) in prefrontal cortex neurons. Successive hyperpolarizing pulses induced increasingly higher rates of tonic firing that remained stable for tens of seconds, allowing the neuron to retain a memory of the previous history of stimulation. This phenomenon occurred at the cellular level and in the absence of neuromodulators. Neurons with HAGPA had a sag during hyperpolarization, and blocking h-current eliminated the sag and prevented HAGPA, suggesting that the activation of this hyperpolarization-activated cationic current was necessary for the occurrence of the phenomenon. A single-neuron biophysical model including h-current modulation by intracellular calcium was able to display HAGPA. This form of neuronal memory not only allows the transformation of inhibition into an increase of firing rate, but also endows neurons with a mechanism to compute the properties of successive inputs into persistent activity, thus solving a difficult computational problem.},

abstract = {We review here the development of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type models of cerebral cortex and thalamic neurons for network simulations. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons were analyzed from several preparations, and we selected the four most prominent electrophysiological classes of neurons. These four classes are "fast spiking", "regular spiking", "intrinsically bursting" and "low-threshold spike" cells. For each class, we fit "minimal" HH type models to experimental data. The models contain the minimal set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the data. To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex. For two cell classes, we used automatic fitting procedures applied to several cells, which revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability within each class. The selection of such cellular models constitutes a necessary step towards building network simulations of the thalamocortical system with realistic cellular dynamical properties.},

abstract = {The power spectrum of local field potentials (LFPs) has been reported to scale as the inverse of the frequency, but the origin of this 1/f noise is at present unclear. Macroscopic measurements in cortical tissue demonstrated that electric conductivity (as well as permittivity) is frequency-dependent, while other measurements failed to evidence any dependence on frequency. In this article, we propose a model of the genesis of LFPs that accounts for the above data and contradictions. Starting from first principles (Maxwell equations), we introduce a macroscopic formalism in which macroscopic measurements are naturally incorporated, and also examine different physical causes for the frequency dependence. We suggest that ionic diffusion primes over electric field effects, and is responsible for the frequency dependence. This explains the contradictory observations, and also reproduces the 1/f power spectral structure of LFPs, as well as more complex frequency scaling. Finally, we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current propagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the predictions of this formalism.},

abstract = {The presence of self-organized criticality in biology is often evidenced by a power-law scaling of event size distributions, which can be measured by linear regression on logarithmic axes. We show here that such a procedure does not necessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first provide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of brain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP peaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not robust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous statistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Similar power-law scaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next investigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic processes can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of underlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent in logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an artificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case, both the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent power-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality, which should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.},

abstract = {Rhythmic local field potential (LFP) oscillations observed during deep sleep are the result of synchronized electrical activities of large neuronal ensembles, which consist of alternating periods of activity and silence, termed 'up' and 'down' states, respectively. Current-source density (CSD) analysis indicates that the up states of these slow oscillations are associated with current sources in superficial cortical layers and sinks in deep layers, while the down states display the opposite pattern of source-sink distribution. We show here that a network model of up and down states displays this CSD profile only if a frequency-filtering extracellular medium is assumed. When frequency filtering was modelled as inhomogeneous conductivity, this simple model had considerably more power in slow frequencies, resulting in significant differences in LFP and CSD profiles compared with the constant-resistivity model. These results suggest that the frequency-filtering properties of extracellular media may have important consequences for the interpretation of the results of CSD analysis.},

abstract = {The relationship between the dynamics of neural networks and their patterns of connectivity is far from clear, despite its importance for understanding functional properties. Here, we have studied sparsely-connected networks of conductance-based integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections and with finite axonal propagation speed. We focused on the genesis of states with highly irregular spiking activity and synchronous firing patterns at low rates, called slow Synchronous Irregular (SI) states. In such balanced networks, we examined the "macroscopic" properties of the spiking activity, such as ensemble correlations and mean firing rates, for different intracortical connectivity profiles ranging from randomly connected networks to networks with Gaussian-distributed local connectivity. We systematically computed the distance-dependent correlations at the extracellular (spiking) and intracellular (membrane potential) levels between randomly assigned pairs of neurons. The main finding is that such properties, when they are averaged at a macroscopic scale, are invariant with respect to the different connectivity patterns, provided the excitatory-inhibitory balance is the same. In particular, the same correlation structure holds for different connectivity profiles. In addition, we examined the response of such networks to external input, and found that the correlation landscape can be modulated by the mean level of synchrony imposed by the external drive. This modulation was found again to be independent of the external connectivity profile. We conclude that first and second-order "mean-field" statistics of such networks do not depend on the details of the connectivity at a microscopic scale. This study is an encouraging step toward a mean-field description of topological neuronal networks.},

To investigate the neural bases of these computations, we applied different spatiotemporal patterns of stimuli to rat whiskers while recording multiple neurons in the barrel cortex. Model-based analysis of the responses revealed different coding schemes according to the level of input correlation. With uncorrelated stimuli on 24 whiskers, we identified two distinct functional categories of neurons, analogous in the temporal domain to simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex. With correlated stimuli, however, a complementary coding scheme emerged: two distinct cell populations, similar to reinforcing and antagonist neurons described in the higher visual area MT, responded specifically to correlations. We suggest that similar context-dependent coexisting coding strategies may be present in other sensory systems to adapt sensory integration to specific stimulus statistics.},

abstract = {Self-organized critical states are found in many natural systems, from earthquakes to forest fires, they have also been observed in neural systems, particularly, in neuronal cultures. However, the presence of critical states in the awake brain remains controversial. Here, we compared avalanche analyses performed on different in vivo preparations during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep, using high density electrode arrays in cat motor cortex (96 electrodes), monkey motor cortex and premotor cortex and human temporal cortex (96 electrodes) in epileptic patients. In neuronal avalanches defined from units (up to 160 single units), the size of avalanches never clearly scaled as power-law, but rather scaled exponentially or displayed intermediate scaling. We also analyzed the dynamics of local field potentials (LFPs) and in particular LFP negative peaks (nLFPs) among the different electrodes (up to 96 sites in temporal cortex or up to 128 sites in adjacent motor and premotor cortices). In this case, the avalanches defined from nLFPs displayed power-law scaling in double logarithmic representations, as reported previously in monkey. However, avalanche defined as positive LFP (pLFP) peaks, which are less directly related to neuronal firing, also displayed apparent power-law scaling. Closer examination of this scaling using the more reliable cumulative distribution function (CDF) and other rigorous statistical measures, did not confirm power-law scaling. The same pattern was seen for cats, monkey, and human, as well as for different brain states of wakefulness and sleep. We also tested other alternative distributions. Multiple exponential fitting yielded optimal fits of the avalanche dynamics with bi-exponential distributions. Collectively, these results show no clear evidence for power-law scaling or self-organized critical states in the awake and sleeping brain of mammals, from cat to man.},

abstract = {Intracranial recording is an important diagnostic method routinely used in a number of neurological monitoring scenarios. In recent years, advancements in such recordings have been extended to include unit activity of an ensemble of neurons. However, a detailed functional characterization of excitatory and inhibitory cells has not been attempted in human neocortex, particularly during the sleep state. Here, we report that such feature discrimination is possible from high-density recordings in the neocortex by using 2D multielectrode arrays. Successful separation of regular-spiking neurons (or bursting cells) from fast-spiking cells resulted in well-defined clusters that each showed unique intrinsic firing properties. The high density of the array, which allowed recording from a large number of cells (up to 90), helped us to identify apparent monosynaptic connections, confirming the excitatory and inhibitory nature of regular-spiking and fast-spiking cells, thus categorized as putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of correlations within each class. A marked exponential decay with distance was observed in the case of excitatory but not for inhibitory cells. Although the amplitude of that decline depended on the timescale at which the correlations were computed, the spatial constant did not. Furthermore, this spatial constant is compatible with the typical size of human columnar organization. These findings provide a detailed characterization of neuronal activity, functional connectivity at the microcircuit level, and the interplay of excitation and inhibition in the human neocortex.},

The calculation of F(T) from experiments and the matching with theoretical expressions is possible for desynchronized states where individual current sources can be considered as independent. Using a mean-field approximation, we obtain a method to estimate the impedance of the extracellular medium without injecting currents. We examine the transfer function for bipolar (differential) LFPs and compare to simultaneous recordings of V(m) and V(LFP) during desynchronized states in rat barrel cortex in vivo. The experimentally derived F(T) matches the one derived theoretically, only if one assumes that the impedance of the extracellular medium is frequency-dependent, and varies as 1/√$\omega$ (Warburg impedance) for frequencies between 3 and 500 Hz. This constitutes indirect evidence that the extracellular medium is non-resistive, which has many possible consequences for modeling LFPs.},

abstract = {Working memory (WM) requires selective information gating, active information maintenance, and rapid active updating. Hence performing a WM task needs rapid and controlled transitions between neural persistent activity and the resting state. We propose that changes in correlations in neural activity provides a mechanism for the required WM operations. As a proof of principle, we implement sustained activity and WM in recurrently coupled spiking networks with neurons receiving excitatory random background activity where background correlations are induced by a common noise source. We first characterize how the level of background correlations controls the stability of the persistent state. With sufficiently high correlations, the sustained state becomes practically unstable, so it cannot be initiated by a transient stimulus. We exploit this in WM models implementing the delay match to sample task by modulating flexibly in time the correlation level at different phases of the task. The modulation sets the network in different working regimes: more prompt to gate in a signal or clear the memory. We examine how the correlations affect the ability of the network to perform the task when distractors are present. We show that in a winner-take-all version of the model, where two populations cross-inhibit, correlations make the distractor blocking robust. In a version of the mode where no cross inhibition is present, we show that appropriate modulation of correlation levels is sufficient to also block the distractor access while leaving the relevant memory trace in tact. The findings presented in this manuscript can form the basis for a new paradigm about how correlations are flexibly controlled by the cortical circuits to execute WM operations.},

Under this localist account, neurons compute near-instantaneous mappings from their current input to their current output, brought about by somatic summation of dendritic contributions that are generated in functionally segregated compartments. However, recent evidence about the presence of oscillations in dendrites suggests a qualitatively different mode of operation: the instantaneous phase of such oscillations can depend on a long history of inputs, and under appropriate conditions, even dendritic oscillators that are remote may interact through synchronization. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the interactions of local dendritic oscillations and the way these interactions influence single cell computations. Combining weakly coupled oscillator methods with cable theoretic arguments, we derive phase-locking states for multiple oscillating dendritic compartments. We characterize how the phase-locking properties depend on key parameters of the oscillating dendrite: the electrotonic properties of the (active) dendritic segment, and the intrinsic properties of the dendritic oscillators. As a direct consequence, we show how input to the dendrites can modulate phase-locking behavior and hence global dendritic coherence. In turn, dendritic coherence is able to gate the integration and propagation of synaptic signals to the soma, ultimately leading to an effective control of somatic spike generation. Our results suggest that dendritic oscillations enable the dendritic tree to operate on more global temporal and spatial scales than previously thought; notably that local dendritic activity may be a mechanism for generating on-going whole-cell voltage oscillations.},

The first one is the complexity of the model ranging from simplified conceptual models that are amenable to mathematical analysis to detailed models that require simulations in order to understand their properties. The second criterion is that of direction of workflow, which can be from microscopic to macroscopic scales (bottom-up) or from behavioral target functions to properties of components (top- down). We review the interaction of theory and simulation using examples of top-down and bottom-up studies and point to some current developments in the fields of computational and theoretical neuroscience.},

abstract = {We investigate how synchrony can be generated or induced in networks of electrically coupled integrate-and-fire neurons subject to noisy and heterogeneous inputs. Using analytical tools, we find that in a network under constant external inputs, synchrony can appear via a Hopf bifurcation from the asynchronous state to an oscillatory state. In a homogeneous net work, in the oscillatory state all neurons fire in synchrony, while in a heterogeneous network synchrony is looser, many neurons skipping cycles of the oscillation. If the transmission of action potentials via the electrical synapses is effectively excitatory, the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical, while effectively inhibitory transmission due to pronounced hyperpolarization leads to a subcritical bifurcation. In the latter case, the network exhibits bistability between an asynchronous state and an oscillatory state where all the neurons fire in synchrony. Finally we show that for time-varying external inputs, electrical coupling enhances the synchronization in an asynchronous network via a resonance at the firing-rate frequency.},

abstract = {Calcium imaging of the spontaneous activity in cortical slices has revealed repeating spatiotemporal patterns of transitions between so-called down states and up states (Ikegaya et al., 2004). Here we fit a model network of stochastic binary neurons to data from these experiments, and in doing so reproduce the distributions of such patterns. We use two versions of this model: (1) an unconnected network in which neurons are activated as independent Poisson processes; and (2) a network with an interaction matrix, estimated from the data, representing effective interactions between the neurons. The unconnected model (model 1) is sufficient to account for the statistics of repeating patterns in 11 of the 15 datasets studied. Model 2, with interactions between neurons, is required to account for pattern statistics of the remaining four. Three of these four datasets are the ones that contain the largest number of transitions, suggesting that long datasets are in general necessary to render interactions statistically visible. We then study the topology of the matrix of interactions estimated for these four datasets. For three of the four datasets, we find sparse matrices with long-tailed degree distributions and an overrepresentation of certain network motifs. The remaining dataset exhibits a strongly interconnected, spatially localized subgroup of neurons. In all cases, we find that interactions between neurons facilitate the generation of long patterns that do not repeat exactly.},

abstract = {Determining how neuronal activity represents sensory information is central for understanding perception. Recent work shows that neural responses at different timescales can encode different stimulus attributes, resulting in a temporal multiplexing of sensory information. Multiplexing increases the encoding capacity of neural responses, enables disambiguation of stimuli that cannot be discriminated at a single response timescale, and makes sensory representations stable to the presence of variability in the sensory world. Thus, as we discuss here, temporal multiplexing could be a key strategy used by the brain to form an information-rich and stable representation of the environment.},

abstract = {The mammalian thalamus forms an obligatory relay for nearly all sensory information that reaches the cerebral cortex. The transmission of sensory information by the thalamus varies in a state-dependent manner, such that during slow wave sleep or drowsiness thalamic responsiveness is markedly reduced, whereas during the waking, attentive state transmission is enhanced. Although activation of brainstem inputs to thalamic neurons has long been assumed to underlie this gating of sensory transfer through the thalamus, numerically the largest input to thalamic relay neurons derives from layer VI cells of the cerebral cortex. Here we report that activation of corticothalamic fibers causes a prolonged excitatory postsynaptic potential in guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate relay neurons resulting from the reduction of a potassium conductance, consistent with the activation of glutamatergic "metabotropic" receptors. This slow depolarization can switch firing of thalamic neurons from the burst firing mode, which is prevalent during slow wave sleep, to the single spike mode, which is prevalent during waking, thereby facilitating transmission of sensory information through the thalamus. This prolonged enhancement of thalamic transfer may allow the cerebral cortex to gate or control selective fields of sensory inputs in a manner that facilitates arousal, attention, and cognition.},

abstract = {Local supra-linear summation of excitatory inputs occurring in pyramidal cell dendrites, the so-called dendritic spikes, results in independent spiking dendritic sub-units, which turn pyramidal neurons into two-layer neural networks capable of computing linearly non-separable functions, such as the exclusive OR. Other neuron classes, such as interneurons, may possess only a few independent dendritic sub-units, or only passive dendrites where input summation is purely sub-linear, and where dendritic sub-units are only saturating. To determine if such neurons can also compute linearly non-separable functions, we enumerate, for a given parameter range, the Boolean functions implementable by a binary neuron model with a linear sub-unit and either a single spiking or a saturating dendritic sub-unit. We then analytically generalize these numerical results to an arbitrary number of non-linear sub-units. First, we show that a single non-linear dendritic sub-unit, in addition to the somatic non-linearity, is sufficient to compute linearly non-separable functions. Second, we analytically prove that, with a sufficient number of saturating dendritic sub-units, a neuron can compute all functions computable with purely excitatory inputs. Third, we show that these linearly non-separable functions can be implemented with at least two strategies: one where a dendritic sub-unit is sufficient to trigger a somatic spike; another where somatic spiking requires the cooperation of multiple dendritic sub-units. We formally prove that implementing the latter architecture is possible with both types of dendritic sub-units whereas the former is only possible with spiking dendrites. Finally, we show how linearly non-separable functions can be computed by a generic two-compartment biophysical model and a realistic neuron model of the cerebellar stellate cell interneuron. Taken together our results demonstrate that passive dendrites are sufficient to enable neurons to compute linearly non-separable functions.},

abstract = {We study a white-noise driven integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron with a time-dependent threshold. We give analytical expressions for mean and variance of the interspike interval assuming that the modification of the threshold value is small. It is shown that the variability of the interval can become both smaller or larger than in the case of constant threshold depending on the decay rate of threshold. We also show that the relative variability is minimal for a certain finite decay rate of the threshold. Furthermore, for slow threshold decay the leaky IF model shows a minimum in the coefficient of variation whenever the firing rate of the neuron matches the decay rate of the threshold. This novel effect can be seen if the firing rate is changed by varying the noise intensity or the mean input current.},

abstract = {The classical coefficient of variation method for "quantal" analysis of synaptic responses allows unambiguous identification of pre- and postsynaptic loci underlying synaptic plasticity only when extensive simplifying restrictions are made. They include invariance of quantal parameters and the assumption that a single afferent produces the evoked potentials or currents. More general theoretical formulations and simulations demonstrate that the standard criteria do not always provide useful guidelines because when the other sources of physiological variance are included, putative pre- and postsynaptic domains may overlap. For example, data typically interpreted as indicating modifications at both sites can be due to a mechanism localized to only one of the two, if parameter variances are taken into consideration in the case of a single input cell, or if there are multiple inputs and the stimulus does not activate all of them reliably. With this perspective, other physiologically realistic hypotheses relevant to the expression of synaptic plasticity, such as that during long-term potentiation, can be envisioned.},

abstract = {Neurophysiological experiments indicate that working memory of an object is maintained by the persistent activity of cells in the prefrontal cortex and infero-temporal cortex of the monkey. This paper considers a cortical network model in which this persistent activity appears due to recurrent synaptic interactions. The conditions under which the magnitude of spontaneous and persistent activity are close to one another (as is found empirically) are investigated using a simplified mean-field description in which firing rates in these states are given by the intersections of a straight line with the f-I curve of a single pyramidal cell. The present analysis relates a network phenomenon - persistent activity in a 'working memory' state - to single-cell data which are accessible to experiment. It predicts that, in networks of the cerebral cortex in which persistent activity phenomena are observed, average synaptic inputs in both spontaneous and persistent activity should bring the cells close to firing threshold. Cells should be slightly sub-threshold in spontaneous activity, and slightly supra-threshold in persistent activity. The results are shown to be robust to the inclusion of inhomogeneities that produce wide distributions of firing rates, in both spontaneous and working memory states.},

abstract = {Shunting inhibition, a conductance increase with a reversal potential close to the resting potential of the cell, has been shown to have a divisive effect on subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. It has therefore been assumed to have the same divisive effect on firing rates. We show that shunting inhibition actually has a subtractive effect on the firing rate in most circumstances. Averaged over several interspike intervals, the spiking mechanism effectively clamps the somatic membrane potential to a value significantly above the resting potential, so that the current through the shunting conductance is approximately independent of the firing rate. This leads to a subtractive rather than a divisive effect. In addition, at distal synapses, shunting inhibition will also have an approximately subtractive effect if the excitatory conductance is not small compared to the inhibitory conductance. Therefore regulating a cell's passive membrane conductance-for instance, via massive feedback-is not an adequate mechanism for normalizing or scaling its output.},

abstract = {In this thesis, we have proposed some novel thought experiments involving foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, using quantum entanglement property. Concerning foundations of quantum mechanics, we have suggested some typical systems including two correlated particles which can distinguish between the two famous theories of quantum mechanics, i.e. the standard and Bohmian quantum mechanics, at the individual level of pair of particles. Meantime, the two theories present the same predictions at the ensemble level of particles. Regarding quantum information theory, two theoretical quantum communication schemes including quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation schemes have been proposed by using entangled spatial states of two EPR particles shared between two parties. It is shown that the rate of classical information gain in our dense coding scheme is greater than some previously proposed multi-qubit protocols by a logarithmic factor dependent on the dimension of Hilbert space. The proposed teleportation scheme can provide a complete wave function teleportation of an object having other degrees of freedom in our three-dimensional space, for the first time. All required unitary operators which are necessary in our state preparation and Bell state measurement processes are designed using symmetric normalized Hadamard matrix, some basic gates and one typical conditional gate, which are introduced here for the first time.},

abstract = {String theory is the most promising candidate for the theory unifying all interactions including gravity. It has an extremely difficult dynamics. Therefore, it is useful to study some its simplifications. One of them is non-critical string theory which can be defined in low dimensions. A particular interesting case is 2D string theory. On the one hand, it has a very rich structure and, on the other hand, it is solvable. A complete solution of 2D string theory in the simplest linear dilaton background was obtained using its representation as Matrix Quantum Mechanics. This matrix model provides a very powerful technique and reveals the integrability hidden in the usual CFT formulation.   This thesis extends the matrix model description of 2D string theory to non-trivial backgrounds. We show how perturbations changing the background are incorporated into Matrix Quantum Mechanics. The perturbations are integrable and governed by Toda Lattice hierarchy. This integrability is used to extract various information about the perturbed system: correlation functions, thermodynamical behaviour, structure of the target space. The results concerning these and some other issues, like non-perturbative effects in non-critical string theory, are presented in the thesis.},

abstract = {Objective: Neuroimaging studies using a variety of techniques have been conducted in sleep to explore the changes in brain activity during the different sleep stages. The current study employed a quantitative meta-analytic technique in an attempt to integrate the findings from such studies. Methods: Using an updated version of the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, individual meta-analyses were carried out on: 1) studies contrasting REM sleep and wake- fulness, and 2) studies contrasting NREM sleep and wakefulness. Results: Based on the results of the current meta-analyses, a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions appear to be involved in sleep and sleep processes, with both decreases and increases noted across NREM and REM sleep. Specifically, areas of decreased activity com- prised thalamic structures (pulvinar, dorsomedial thalamus) and frontal regions (inferior, superior, and middle frontal gyrus). Furthermore, increased and decreased activity was noted in the anterior cingulate during sleep. Conclusions: Despite limited overlap across these sleep stages among regions identified, consistent decreases were revealed in NREM sleep (thalamus) and REM sleep (frontal cortex) when compared to wakefulness. Such findings suggest that these regions may ultimately play a key role in the loss of consciousness characteristic of sleep. Further research is needed to determine if and how such activity may be related to dreaming.},

abstract = {Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded in behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of "background" synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron acts as a gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory drive.},

abstract = {Spontaneous neural activity is crucial for the formation of the intricate patterns of cortical connectivity during development. In particular, temporal correlations in presynaptic and postsynaptic activity have been hypothesized to be a critical determinant in the selection of neurons that are to become wired together. To date, however, temporally correlated activity in the neonatal brain has been believed to take place with a precision of tens of milliseconds to seconds. Here we describe a novel type of a fast network oscillation associated with millisecond synchronization of pyramidal cell firing in newborn rat hippocampus in vitro. Individual pyramidal neurons fired mainly at lower gamma frequencies (20-40 Hz) but were synchronized into a high-frequency (100-400 Hz) population oscillation that was reflected in field potential spikes and intracellular AMPA-kainate receptor-mediated currents. The high-frequency population oscillation was patterned by a gamma-frequency modulatory oscillation. The gamma modulation was imposed by GABAergic currents, which exerted an inhibitory action on pyramidal neurons. Patterned activity based on GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation thus occurs already in newborn hippocampus. The network oscillations described here may be a mechanism for selective coincidence detection with a millisecond range temporal precision to shape the patterns of connectivity within the emerging hippocampal synaptic circuitry.},

abstract = {When the local field potential of a cortical network displays coherent fast oscillations ( approximately 40-Hz gamma or approximately 200-Hz sharp-wave ripples), the spike trains of constituent neurons are typically irregular and sparse. The dichotomy between rhythmic local field and stochastic spike trains presents a challenge to the theory of brain rhythms in the framework of coupled oscillators. Previous studies have shown that when noise is large and recurrent inhibition is strong, a coherent network rhythm can be generated while single neurons fire intermittently at low rates compared to the frequency of the oscillation. However, these studies used too simplified synaptic kinetics to allow quantitative predictions of the population rhythmic frequency. Here we show how to derive quantitatively the coherent oscillation frequency for a randomly connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic synaptic parameters. In a noise-dominated interneuronal network, the oscillation frequency depends much more on the shortest synaptic time constants (delay and rise time) than on the longer synaptic decay time, and approximately 200-Hz frequency can be realized with synaptic time constants taken from slice data. In a network composed of both interneurons and excitatory cells, the rhythmogenesis is a compromise between two scenarios: the fast purely interneuronal mechanism, and the slower feedback mechanism (relying on the excitatory-inhibitory loop). The properties of the rhythm are determined essentially by the ratio of time scales of excitatory and inhibitory currents and by the balance between the mean recurrent excitation and inhibition. Faster excitation than inhibition, or a higher excitation/inhibition ratio, favors the feedback loop and a much slower oscillation (typically in the gamma range).},

abstract = {Periodicity is a fundamental sound attribute. Its coding has been the subject of intensive research, most of which has focused on investigating how the periodicity of sounds is processed through the synaptic machinery in the brain. The extent to which the intrinsic properties of cells play in periodicity coding, particularly in the creation of selectivity to periodic signals, is not well understood. We performed in vitro whole-cell patch recordings in the frog torus semicircularis to investigate each neuron's intrinsic membrane properties as well as responses to sinusoidal current injected through the electrode and periodic stimulation of the ascending afferent. We found that: (i) toral neurons were heterogeneous, showing diverse biophysical phenotypes having distinct membrane characteristics, including membrane time constants (tau) and ionic channel compositions (I(h), I(kir), I(kv) and I(NaP)); (ii) a neuron's tau was tightly correlated with its current-evoked frequency preference (FP; range: 0.05-50 Hz); (iii) application of blockers for I(h), I(kir) and I(kv) (but not I(NaP)) shifted the tau as well as the cell's current-evoked FP, suggesting that these ion channels contribute to the cell's FP through regulation of tau; (iv) a neuron's tau was also correlated with its afferent-evoked FP (range: 10-300 pulses/s); and (v) the range of afferent-evoked FP was approximately one order higher than the range of current-evoked FPs, suggesting that both the cell's intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties contribute to determining the afferent-evoked cell-specific FP (whose range matched those of cell-specific responses to sound stimulation, e.g. selectivity to amplitude modulation rate).},

abstract = {Changes in neuronal surface area may be monitored by measuring the plasma membrane capacitance [8]. Membrane time constant (??(m)) is given by the product of the membrane resistance (??(m)) and membrane capacitance (c(m)), ??(m) = r(m)c(m). Thus, when membrane resistance is kept constant at a steady state (resting), membrane time constant can reflect the size of neuronal surface area. Membrane time constant is the time for the potential to fall from the resting to a fraction (1 - 1/e) or 63{\%}, of its final value in the charging curve during the application of a small negative current pulse [9]. negative voltage shift from the resting potential hardly activates any voltage-dependent ion channel, resulting in nominal changes in cell membrane resistance. Although elaborated methods for mathematical models and simulations are available for the electrophysiological assessment of neuron geometry in order to estimate subthreshold potential attenuation during the propagation of synaptically mediated electrical signals [1,4,10], they involve a number of critical assumptions for the convenience to each model, and some of these assumptions are unlikely to be valid [7]. With these restrictive assumptions, very little can be determined about the electrotonic structure of a neuron beyond the measurement of neuronal membrane resistance and membrane time constant. Alternatively, numerous tracers are available to visualize morphologies of neurons intracellularly and extracellularly. These anatomical methods provide direct and quantitative evidence for neuron geometry; however, they involve tissue processing and a series of chemical reactions, some of which are time- and effort-demanding. The purpose of the present paper is to show that membrane time constant can be effectively used as a tool to assess diminution in cell surface area without involving extensive mathematical theories and/or neuroanatomical techniques. This approach is particularly effective in electrotonically compact cells such as hippocampal neurons [1]. Recent development in the technique of the whole- cell patch clamp recording in the slice preparation yielded longer time constant with better resolution due to the absence of the leak conductance associated with microelectrode impalement [10]. Indeed, when membrane time constant was measured with the whole-cell patch clamp recording technique, it successfully detected the reduction in dendritic arbors (dendritic degeneration) in dentate granule cells in the pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy, and this finding is supported by the neuroanatomical evidence that was obtained from the same specimen samples [6]. Membrane time constant is an easy-to-measure 'passive membrane property' and can be used as a reliable probe by itself for detecting dencritic degeneration, or as a tool for decision-making in introducing neuroanatomical technique in combination with slice neurophysiology.},

abstract = {To facilitate the characterization of cortical neuronal function, the responses of cells in cat area 17 to intracellular injection of current pulses were quantitatively analyzed. A variety of response variables were used to separate the cells into subtypes using cluster analysis. Four main classes of neurons could be clearly distinguished: regular spiking (RS), fast spiking (FS), intrinsic bursting (IB), and chattering (CH). Each of these contained significant subclasses. RS neurons were characterized by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. FS neurons had short-duration action potentials ({\textless}0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal cells. IB neurons typically generated a low frequency ({\textless}425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer 5. Finally, CH neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of short-duration ({\textless}0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological classes and subclasses.},

Physiological activity interspersed with epochs of pathological hyperactivity in the epileptic brain represents a clinically relevant yet poorly understood case of such rich dynamic repertoire. Using a realistic computational model, we demonstrate that physiological sparse and pathological tonic-clonic activity may coexist in the same cortical network for identical afferent input level. Transient perturbations in the afferent input were sufficient to switch the network between these two stable states. The effectiveness of the potassium regulatory apparatus determined the stability of the physiological state and the threshold for seizure initiation. Our findings contrast with the common notions of (1) pathological brain activity representing dynamic instabilities and (2) necessary adjustments of experimental conditions to elicit different network states. Rather, we propose that the rich dynamic repertoire of cortical networks may be based on multistabilities intrinsic to the network.},

These dynamics are characterized by translaminar assemblies of neurons whose activity synchronizes rhythmically in space and time. How different cortical layers influence the formation of these spontaneous cellular assemblies is poorly understood. We found that excitatory neurons in supragranular and infragranular layers have distinct roles in the regulation of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations in mice in vivo. Optogenetic activation of infragranular neurons generated network activity that resembled spontaneous events, whereas photoinhibition of these same neurons substantially attenuated slow ongoing dynamics. In contrast, light activation and inhibition of supragranular cells had modest effects on spontaneous slow activity. This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first causal demonstration that excitatory circuits located in distinct cortical layers differentially control spontaneous low-frequency dynamics.},

abstract = {While exploring objects, rats make multiple contacts using their whiskers, thereby generating complex patterns of sensory information. The cerebral structures that process this information in the somatosensory system show discrete patterns of anatomically distinct units, each corresponding to one whisker. Moreover, the feedforward and feedback connections are remarkably topographic, with little cross-whisker divergence before reaching the cortical network. Despite this parallel design, information processing from several whiskers has been reported in subcortical nuclei. Here, we explored whether sensory neurons in the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus encode emergent properties of complex multiwhisker stimulations. Using a 24-whisker stimulator, we tested the responses of VPM neurons to sequences of caudal deflections that generated an apparent motion in eight different directions across the whiskerpad. Overall, 45{\%} of neurons exhibited an evoked increase in firing rate significantly selective to the direction of apparent motion of the global stimulus. Periods of suppression of firing rate were often observed, but were generally not selective. Global motion selectivity of VPM neurons could occur regardless of the extent and spatial organization of their receptive fields, and of their selectivity for the direction of motion of their principal whisker. To investigate whether the global selectivity could be due to corticothalamic feedback connections, we inactivated the barrel cortex while repeating the stimulation protocol. For most VPM neurons, the direction selectivity decreased but was still present. These results suggest that nonlinear processing of stimuli from different whiskers emerges in subcortical nuclei and is amplified by the corticofugal feedback.},

abstract = {Fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by activation of synaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors. In hippocampal slices, we report that stimulation of Schaffer collaterals evokes in CA1 neurons delayed inward currents with slow kinetics, in addition to fast excitatory postsynaptic currents. Similar slow events also occur spontaneously, can still be observed when neuronal activity and synaptic glutamate release are blocked, and are found to be mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes acting preferentially on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. The slow currents can be triggered by stimuli that evoke Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes, including photolysis of caged Ca2+ in single astrocytes. As revealed by paired recording and Ca2+ imaging, a striking feature of this NMDA receptor response is that it occurs synchronously in multiple CA1 neurons. Our results reveal a distinct mechanism for neuronal excitation and synchrony and highlight a functional link between astrocytic glutamate and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.},

abstract = {We report the results of our experimental and theoretical investigations of the neural response dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1) during naturalistic visual stimulation. We recorded Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity from V1 of anaesthetized macaques during binocular presentation of Hollywood color movies. We analyzed these recordings with information theoretic methods, and found that visual information was encoded mainly by two bands of LFP responses: the network fluctuations measured by the phase and power of low-frequency (less than 12 Hz) LFPs; and fast gamma-range (50-100 Hz) oscillations. Both the power and phase of low frequency LFPs carried information largely complementary to that carried by spikes, whereas gamma range oscillations carried information largely redundant to that of spikes. To interpret these results within a quantitative theoretical framework, we then simulated a sparsely connected recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons receiving slowly varying naturalistic inputs, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encoded information about the inputs. We found that this simulated recurrent network reproduced well the experimentally observed dependency of LFP information upon frequency. This network encoded the overall strength of the input into the power of gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions, and encoded slow variations in the input by entraining the network LFP at the corresponding frequency. This dynamical behavior accounted quantitatively for the independent information carried by high and low frequency LFPs, and for the experimentally observed cross-frequency coupling between phase of slow LFPs and the power of gamma LFPs. We also present new results showing that the model's dynamics also accounted for the extra visual information that the low-frequency LFP phase of spike firing carries beyond that carried by spike rates. Overall, our results suggest biological mechanisms by which cortex can multiplex information about naturalistic sensory environments.},

abstract = {Correlated spiking is often observed in cortical circuits, but its functional role is controversial. It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a reexamination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing.},

abstract = {We consider a model of an integrate-and-fire neuron with synaptic current dynamics, in which the synaptic time constant tau' is much smaller than the membrane time constant tau. We calculate analytically the firing frequency of such a neuron for inputs described by a random Gaussian process. We find that the first order correction to the frequency due to tau' is proportional to the square root of the ratio between these time constants radicaltau'/tau. This implies that the correction is important even when the synaptic time constant is small compared with that of the potential. The frequency of a neuron with tau'{\textgreater}0 can be reduced to that of the basic IF neuron (corresponding to tau'=1) using an "effective" threshold which has a linear dependence on radical tau'/tau. Numerical simulations show a very good agreement with the analytical result, and permit an extrapolation of the "effective" threshold to higher orders in radical tau'/tau. The obtained frequency agrees with simulation data for a wide range of parameters.},

@article{Joucla2011,
abstract = {Extracellular electrical stimulation of neural networks has been widely used empirically for decades with individual electrodes. Since recently, microtechnology provides advanced systems with high-density microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Taking the most of these devices for fundamental goals or developing neural prosthesis requires a good knowledge of the mechanisms underlying electrical stimulation. Here, we review modeling approaches used to determine (1) the electric potential field created by a stimulation and (2) the response of an excitable cell to an applied field. Computation of the potential field requires solving the Poisson equation. While this can be performed analytically in simple electrode-neuron configurations, numerical models are required for realistic geometries. In these models, special care must be taken to model the potential drop at the electrode/tissue interface using appropriate boundary conditions. The neural response to the field can then be calculated using compartmentalized cell models, by solving a cable equation, the source term of which (called activating function) is proportional to the second derivative of the extracellular field along the neural arborization. Analytical and numerical solutions to this equation are first presented. Then, we discuss the use of approximated solutions to intuitively predict the neuronal response: Either the "activating function" or the "mirror estimate", depending on the pulse duration and the cell space constant. Finally, we address the design of optimal electrode configurations allowing the selective activation of neurons near each stimulation site. This can be achieved using either multipolar configurations, or the "ground surface" configuration, which can be easily integrated in high-density MEAs. Overall, models highlighting the mechanisms of electrical microstimulation and improving stimulating devices should help understanding the influence of extracellular fields on neural elements and developing optimized neural prostheses for rehabilitation.},

abstract = {1. The properties of glutamate receptor (GluR) channels in outside-out patches from the dendrites and somata of rat cerebellar Purkinje cells in brain slice were studied using fast agonist application techniques. Dendritic patches were isolated 40-130 micronm from the soma. 2. Outside-out patches from both dendrites and somata of Purkinje cells responded to application of glutamate with a current which desensitized rapidly and nearly completely. Currents evoked by glutamate application were blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), were mimicked by L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), and were modulated by cyclothiazide. Kainate produced small, non-desensitizing currents. No currents were observed in response to aspartate application. Responses characteristic of NMDA receptor activation were not observed. These findings indicate that glutamate-activated currents were mediated by the AMPA subtype of GluR. 3. Deactivation of the GluR channels following 1 ms pulses of glutamate occurred with a time constant of 1.23 +/- 0.07 ms in dendritic and 1.12 +/- 0.04 ms in somatic patches. Desensitization occurred with a time constant of 5.37 +/- 0.26 ms in dendritic and 5.29 +/- 0.29 ms in somatic patches. The time constant of recovery from desensitization caused by a 1 ms application of 1 mM glutamate was 36 ms in dendritic patches and 33 ms in somatic patches. 4. Half-maximal activation of the GluR channels was achieved at a glutamate concentration of 432 microM. Deactivation kinetics were not dependent on the glutamate concentration, while desensitization became slower at lower glutamate concentrations. 5. Pre-equilibration of patches with low concentrations of glutamate reduced the peak current activated by 1 mM glutamate. The IC50 for this effect was 8.7 microM. Equilibrium desensitization did not affect the kinetics of the current activated by 1 mM glutamate. 6. The current-voltage relationship of the peak current was linear in normal Na(+)-rich external solution, with a reversal potential near 0 mV. In Ca(2+) -rich external solution, the reversal potentials were -51.4 +/- 2.9 and -51.5 +/- 2.8 mV for dendritic and somatic patches, respectively, indicating that these glutamate channels have a low permeability to Ca2+ (PCa/PCa = 0.053). 7. The mean single-channel conductance of the GluR channels measured using non-stationary fluctuation analysis was approximately 8 pS in dendritic and somatic patches, and the maximum open probability was at least 0.7 with 5 mM glutamate. 8. GluR channel kinetics in patches excised from the soma of neonatal (postnatal day 4; P4) Purkinje cells, before the development of the dendritic arborization of the Purkinje cell, were similar to those in patches excised from more mature (P12-18) Purkinje cells. 9. Dendritic and somatic GluR channels in Purkinje cells appear to be functionally identical, are AMPA-subtype receptors containing the GluR-B subunit, and have rapid kinetics and low permeability to Ca2+. A kinetic model was constructed which faithfully reproduces the gating characteristics of the GluR channels.},

abstract = {In neocortical neurons, network activity can activate a large number of synaptic inputs, resulting in highly irregular subthreshold membrane potential (V(m)) fluctuations, commonly called "synaptic noise." This activity contains information about the underlying network dynamics, but it is not easy to extract network properties from such complex and irregular activity. Here, we propose a method to estimate properties of network activity from intracellular recordings and test this method using theoretical and experimental approaches. The method is based on the analytic expression of the subthreshold V(m) distribution at steady state in conductance-based models. Fitting this analytic expression to V(m) distributions obtained from intracellular recordings provides estimates of the mean and variance of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. We test the accuracy of these estimates against computational models of increasing complexity. We also test the method using dynamic-clamp recordings of neocortical neurons in vitro. By using an on-line analysis procedure, we show that the measured conductances from spontaneous network activity can be used to re-create artificial states equivalent to real network activity. This approach should be applicable to intracellular recordings during different network states in vivo, providing a characterization of the global properties of synaptic conductances and possible insight into the underlying network mechanisms.},

abstract = {We propose a method for the time-resolved joint analysis of two related aspects of single neuron variability, the spiking irregularity measured by the squared coefficient of variation (CV(2)) of the ISIs and the trial-by-trial variability of the spike count measured by the Fano factor (FF). We provide a calibration of both estimators using the theory of renewal processes, and verify it for spike trains recorded in vitro. Both estimators exhibit a considerable bias for short observations that count less than about 5-10 spikes on average. The practical difficulty of measuring the CV(2) in rate modulated data can be overcome by a simple procedure of spike train demodulation which was tested in numerical simulations and in real spike trains. We propose to test neuronal spike trains for deviations from the null-hypothesis FF=CV(2). We show that cortical pyramidal neurons, recorded under controlled stationary input conditions in vitro, comply with this assumption. Performing a time-resolved joint analysis of CV(2) and FF of a single unit recording from the motor cortex of a behaving monkey we demonstrate how the dynamic change of their quantitative relation can be interpreted with respect to neuron intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence cortical variability in vivo. Finally, we discuss the effect of several additional factors such as serial interval correlation and refractory period on the empiric relation of FF and CV(2).},

abstract = {Throughout the central nervous system, the timescale over which pairs of neural spike trains are correlated is shaped by stimulus structure and behavioral context. Such shaping is thought to underlie important changes in the neural code, but the neural circuitry responsible is largely unknown. In this study, we investigate a stimulus-induced shaping of pairwise spike train correlations in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish. Simultaneous single unit recordings of principal electrosensory cells show that an increase in the spatial extent of stimuli increases correlations at short (≈ 10 ms) timescales while simultaneously reducing correlations at long (≈ 100 ms) timescales. A spiking network model of the first two stages of electrosensory processing replicates this correlation shaping, under the assumptions that spatially broad stimuli both saturate feedforward afferent input and recruit an open-loop inhibitory feedback pathway. Our model predictions are experimentally verified using both the natural heterogeneity of the electrosensory system and pharmacological blockade of descending feedback projections. For weak stimuli, linear response analysis of the spiking network shows that the reduction of long timescale correlation for spatially broad stimuli is similar to correlation cancellation mechanisms previously suggested to be operative in mammalian cortex. The mechanism for correlation shaping supports population-level filtering of irrelevant distractor stimuli, thereby enhancing the population response to relevant prey and conspecific communication inputs.},

Naundorf et al. fail to explain these features using single- or double-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-style models, suggesting instead that they could arise from cooperative opening of Na+ channels, although there is no direct biological evidence to support this. Here we show that these so-called unique features are to be expected from Hodgkin-Huxley models if the spatial geometry and spike initiation properties of cortical neurons are taken into account--it is therefore unnecessary to invoke exotic channel-gating properties as an explanation.},

@article{Milescu2010,
abstract = {We present a simple and effective method for isolating the somatic Na(+) current recorded under voltage clamp from neurons in brain slices. The principle is to convert the axon from an active compartment capable of generating uncontrolled axonal spikes into a passive structure by selectively inactivating axonal Na(+) channels. Typically, whole-cell currents from intact neurons under somatic voltage clamp contain a mixture of Na(+) current and axial current caused by escaped axonal spikes. We found that a brief prepulse to voltages near spike threshold evokes the axonal spike, which inactivates axonal but not somatic channels. A subsequent voltage step then evokes only somatic Na(+) current from electrotonically proximal sodium channels under good voltage-clamp control. Simulations using a neuron compartmental model support the idea that the prepulse effectively inactivates currents from the axon and isolates well controlled somatic currents. Na(+) currents recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons in slices, using the prepulse, were found to have voltage dependence nearly identical to that of currents recorded from acutely dissociated pyramidal neurons. In addition, studies in dissociated neurons show that the prepulse has no visible effect on the voltage dependence and kinetics of Na(+) currents elicited by the subsequent voltage step, only decreasing the amplitude of the currents by 10-20{\%}. The technique was effective in several neuronal types in brain slices from male and female neonatal rats and mice, including raph{\'{e}} neurons, cortical pyramidal neurons, inferior olivary neurons, and hypoglossal motoneurons.},

abstract = {The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized in vivo by irregular spontaneous activity, but how this ongoing dynamics affects signal processing and learning remains unknown. The associative plasticity rules demonstrated in vitro, mostly in silent networks, are based on the detection of correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity and hence are sensitive to spontaneous activity and spurious correlations. Therefore, they cannot operate in realistic network states. Here, we present a new class of spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules with local floating plasticity thresholds, the slow dynamics of which account for metaplasticity. This novel algorithm is shown to both correctly predict homeostasis in synaptic weights and solve the problem of asymptotic stable learning in noisy states. It is shown to naturally encompass many other known types of learning rule, unifying them into a single coherent framework. The mixed presynaptic and postsynaptic dependency of the floating plasticity threshold is justified by a cascade of known molecular pathways, which leads to experimentally testable predictions.},

abstract = {1. To explore the nature of the long-lasting hyperpolarizations that characterize slow oscillations in corticothalamic circuits in vivo, intracellular recordings were obtained under ketamine-xylazine anaesthesia from cortical (Cx) cells of the cat precruciate motor cortex, thalamic reticular (RE) cells from the rostrolateral sector, and thalamocortical (TC) cells from the ventrolateral (VL) nucleus. 2. Measurements in the three cell types showed input resistance (Rin) to be highest during the long-lasting hyperpolarizations that correspond to depth-positive waves of the cortical EEG. Rin was lowest during the early phase of high-amplitude depth-negative EEG waves and increased thereafter until the next cycle of the slow oscillation. 3. Spontaneous long-lasting hyperpolarizations were compared with those evoked by dorsal thalamic stimulation. Voltage versus current (V-I) plots showed similar membrane potential (Vm) ranges and slopes for spontaneous and evoked hyperpolarizations in both Cx and RE cells. V-I plots from TC cells had similar slopes, but Vm during evoked hyperpolarizations was displaced towards more negative values. 4. Intracellular injection of constant hyperpolarizing current in Cx cells increased the amplitude of the initial part of the depolarizing plateau of the slow oscillation, but decreased the amplitude of the last part. 5. These results suggest disfacilitation to be the dominant mechanism in the membrane of cortical and thalamic cells during the spontaneous long-lasting hyperpolarizations, which shape and synchronize slow oscillations in corticothalamic networks. In Cx and RE cells, the same mechanism underlies thalamically evoked long-lasting hyperpolarizations. By contrast, evoked responses in TC cells show a strong additional hyperpolarizing factor. We propose that GABAB processes are stronger in TC than in Cx neurones, thus rendering the thalamus an easier target for absence-type epileptic phenomena through potentiation of thalamic rebound capabilities.},

abstract = {During wakefulness, neocortical neurons are subjected to an intense synaptic bombardment. To assess the consequences of this background activity for the integrative properties of pyramidal neurons, we constrained biophysical models with in vivo intracellular data obtained in anesthetized cats during periods of intense network activity similar to that observed in the waking state. In pyramidal cells of the parietal cortex (area 5-7), synaptic activity was responsible for an approximately fivefold decrease in input resistance (Rin), a more depolarized membrane potential (Vm), and a marked increase in the amplitude of Vm fluctuations, as determined by comparing the same cells before and after microperfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The model was constrained by measurements of Rin, by the average value and standard deviation of the Vm measured from epochs of intense synaptic activity recorded with KAc or KCl-filled pipettes as well as the values measured in the same cells after TTX. To reproduce all experimental results, the simulated synaptic activity had to be of relatively high frequency (1-5 Hz) at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In addition, synaptic inputs had to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.1) to reproduce the amplitude of Vm fluctuations recorded experimentally. The presence of voltage-dependent K+ currents, estimated from current-voltage relations after TTX, affected these parameters by {\textless}10{\%}. The model predicts that the conductance due to synaptic activity is 7-30 times larger than the somatic leak conductance to be consistent with the approximately fivefold change in Rin. The impact of this massive increase in conductance on dendritic attenuation was investigated for passive neurons and neurons with voltage-dependent Na+/K+ currents in soma and dendrites. In passive neurons, correlated synaptic bombardment had a major influence on dendritic attenuation. The electrotonic attenuation of simulated synaptic inputs was enhanced greatly in the presence of synaptic bombardment, with distal synapses having minimal effects at the soma. Similarly, in the presence of dendritic voltage-dependent currents, the convergence of hundreds of synaptic inputs was required to evoke action potentials reliably. In this case, however, dendritic voltage-dependent currents minimized the variability due to input location, with distal apical synapses being as effective as synapses on basal dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of intracellular and computational data suggests that, during low-amplitude fast electroencephalographic activity, neocortical neurons are bombarded continuously by correlated synaptic inputs at high frequency, which significantly affect their integrative properties. A series of predictions are suggested to test this model.},

@article{Reynaud2012,
abstract = {To efficiently drive many behaviors, sensory systems have to integrate the activity of large neuronal populations within a limited time window. These populations need to rapidly achieve a robust representation of the input image, probably through canonical computations such as divisive normalization. However, little is known about the dynamics of the corticocortical interactions implementing these rapid and robust computations. Here, we measured the real-time activity of a large neuronal population in V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in behaving monkeys. We found that contrast gain of the population increases over time with a time constant of {\~{}}30 ms and propagates laterally over the cortical surface. This dynamic is well accounted for by a divisive normalization achieved through a recurrent network that transiently increases in size after response onset with a slow swelling speed of 0.007-0.014 m/s, suggesting a polysynaptic intracortical origin. In the presence of a surround, this normalization pool is gradually balanced by lateral inputs propagating from distant cortical locations. This results in a centripetal propagation of surround suppression at a speed of 0.1-0.3 m/s, congruent with horizontal intracortical axons speed. We propose that a simple generalized normalization scheme can account for both the dynamical contrast response function through recurrent polysynaptic intracortical loops and for the surround suppression through long-range monosynaptic horizontal spread. Our results demonstrate that V1 achieves a rapid and robust context-dependent input normalization through a timely push-pull between local and lateral networks. We suggest that divisive normalization, a fundamental canonical computation, should be considered as a dynamic process.},

abstract = {The responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to drifting luminance or cone isolating gratings of different spatial frequencies and contrasts were measured. The response noise, defined as the variability of the responses to single sweeps in the complex plane, was independent of stimulus contrast and spatial frequency but increased with increasing overall responsiveness of the cell. The signal-to-noise ratio of parvocellular (PC) cells was smaller than of magnocellular (MC) cells. At each contrast, the response amplitude as a function of spatial frequency could be described with a difference of Gaussians model. With this model, the sizes and the peak sensitivities of the receptive field centers and surrounds were estimated. It was found that receptive field center and surround sizes of LGN cells decrease slightly with increasing contrast. Further, the peak sensitivity decreases with increasing contrast. The two factors are involved in a decrease in responsivity (the response per unit contrast) with increasing contrast which is compatible to response saturation for low spatial frequency stimuli. PC cells did not saturate as much to luminance stimuli although some saturation was found with cone isolating gratings. We found that the response phase lag of both PC and MC cells decreased with increasing contrast, which cannot be explained on the basis of linear response behavior. Apparently the phase of LGN cell responses to drifting gratings is altered in comparison with the retinal inputs by additional nonlinearities.},

abstract = {Recent physiological studies using behaving monkeys revealed that, in a two-alternative forced-choice visual motion discrimination task, reaction time was correlated with ramping of spike activity of lateral intraparietal cortical neurons. The ramping activity appears to reflect temporal accumulation, on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, of sensory evidence before a decision is reached. To elucidate the cellular and circuit basis of such integration times, we developed and investigated a simplified two-variable version of a biophysically realistic cortical network model of decision making. In this model, slow time integration can be achieved robustly if excitatory reverberation is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors; our model with only fast AMPA receptors at recurrent synapses produces decision times that are not comparable with experimental observations. Moreover, we found two distinct modes of network behavior, in which decision computation by winner-take-all competition is instantiated with or without attractor states for working memory. Decision process is closely linked to the local dynamics, in the "decision space" of the system, in the vicinity of an unstable saddle steady state that separates the basins of attraction for the two alternative choices. This picture provides a rigorous and quantitative explanation for the dependence of performance and response time on the degree of task difficulty, and the reason for which reaction times are longer in error trials than in correct trials as observed in the monkey experiment. Our reduced two-variable neural model offers a simple yet biophysically plausible framework for studying perceptual decision making in general.},

This process allows neurons to code for informative scene or object attributes in a manner unaffected by changes in illumination. Evidence for normalization is seen in striate and extrastriate cortex from experiments where multiple stimuli are presented with a single receptive field (RF). Neuronal responses in such experiments are smaller than that predicted by linear summation, revealing the presence of normalization. While the presence of normalization is often clear, its mechanism is less so. To study the mechanism of normalization, we measured the interaction between pairs of brief local stimuli (spatial Gabor functions) within the RFs of cells in the middle temporal (MT or V5) area of monkeys and varied both the location and contrast of the stimuli. We found response summed approximately linearly when contrast was low but rapidly became normalized as stimulus contrast increased. The rapid transition to effective normalization at low contrasts suggested cooperativity in the normalization, and a model embodying such a cooperative step provided a good account of our data.},

abstract = {We study a rate-model neural network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in which neuronal input-output functions are power laws with a power greater than 1, as observed in primary visual cortex. This supralinear input-output function leads to supralinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs for weak inputs. We show that for stronger inputs, which would drive the excitatory subnetwork to instability, the network will dynamically stabilize provided feedback inhibition is sufficiently strong. For a wide range of network and stimulus parameters, this dynamic stabilization yields a transition from supralinear to sublinear summation of network responses to multiple inputs. We compare this to the dynamic stabilization in the "balanced network", which yields only linear behavior. We more exhaustively analyze the 2-dimensional case of 1 excitatory and 1 inhibitory population. We show that in this case dynamic stabilization will occur whenever the determinant of the weight matrix is positive and the inhibitory time constant is sufficiently small, and analyze the conditions for "supersaturation", or decrease of firing rates with increasing stimulus contrast (which represents increasing input firing rates). In work to be presented elsewhere, we have found that this transition from supralinear to sublinear summation can explain a wide variety of nonlinearities in cerebral cortical processing.},

abstract = {How the axonal distribution of Na(+) channels affects the precision of spike timing is not well understood. We addressed this question in auditory relay neurons of the avian nucleus magnocellularis. These neurons encode and convey information about the fine structure of sounds to which they are tuned by generating precisely timed action potentials in response to synaptic inputs. Patterns of synaptic inputs differ as a function of tuning. A small number of large inputs innervate high- and middle-frequency neurons, while a large number of small inputs innervate low-frequency neurons. We found that the distribution and density of Na(+) channels in the axon initial segments varied with the synaptic inputs, and were distinct in the low-frequency neurons. Low-frequency neurons had a higher density of Na(+) channels within a longer axonal stretch, and showed a larger spike amplitude and whole-cell Na(+) current than high/middle-frequency neurons. Computer simulations revealed that for low-frequency neurons, a large number of Na(+) channels were crucial for preserving spike timing because it overcame Na(+) current inactivation and K(+) current activation during compound EPSPs evoked by converging small inputs. In contrast, fewer channels were sufficient to generate a spike with high precision in response to an EPSP induced by a single massive input in the high/middle-frequency neurons. Thus the axonal Na(+) channel distribution is effectively coupled with synaptic inputs, allowing these neurons to convey auditory information in the timing of firing.},

abstract = {Neurons transform time-varying inputs into action potentials emitted stochastically at a time dependent rate. The mapping from current input to output firing rate is often represented with the help of phenomenological models such as the linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade, in which the output firing rate is estimated by applying to the input successively a linear temporal filter and a static non-linear transformation. These simplified models leave out the biophysical details of action potential generation. It is not a priori clear to which extent the input-output mapping of biophysically more realistic, spiking neuron models can be reduced to a simple linear-nonlinear cascade. Here we investigate this question for the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF), exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) and conductance-based Wang-Buzs{\'{a}}ki models in presence of background synaptic activity. We exploit available analytic results for these models to determine the corresponding linear filter and static non-linearity in a parameter-free form. We show that the obtained functions are identical to the linear filter and static non-linearity determined using standard reverse correlation analysis. We then quantitatively compare the output of the corresponding linear-nonlinear cascade with numerical simulations of spiking neurons, systematically varying the parameters of input signal and background noise. We find that the LN cascade provides accurate estimates of the firing rates of spiking neurons in most of parameter space. For the EIF and Wang-Buzs{\'{a}}ki models, we show that the LN cascade can be reduced to a firing rate model, the timescale of which we determine analytically. Finally we introduce an adaptive timescale rate model in which the timescale of the linear filter depends on the instantaneous firing rate. This model leads to highly accurate estimates of instantaneous firing rates.},

abstract = {Period-doubling bifurcation to chaos were discovered in spontaneous firings of Onchidium pacemaker neurons. In this paper, we provide three cases of bifurcation processes related to period-doubling bifurcation cascades to chaos observed in the spontaneous firing patterns recorded from an injured site of rat sciatic nerve as a pacemaker. Period-doubling bifurcation cascades to period-4 ($\pi$(2,2)) firstly, and then to chaos, at last to a periodicity, which can be period-5, period-4 ($\pi$(4)) and period-3, respectively, in different pacemakers. The three bifurcation processes are labeled as case I, II and III, respectively, manifesting procedures different to those of period-adding bifurcation. Higher-dimensional unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) can be detected in the chaos, built close relationships to the periodic firing patterns. Case III bifurcation process is similar to that discovered in the Onchidium pacemaker neurons and simulated in theoretical model-Chay model. The extra-large Feigenbaum constant manifesting in the period-doubling bifurcation process, induced by quasi-discontinuous characteristics exhibited in the first return maps of both ISI series and slow variable of Chay model, shows that higher-dimensional periodic behaviors appeared difficult within the period-doubling bifurcation cascades. The results not only provide examples of period-doubling bifurcation to chaos and chaos with higher-dimensional UPOs, but also reveal the dynamical features of the period-doubling bifurcation cascades to chaos.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explain critical features of the human primary generalized epilepsies by investigating the dynamical bifurcations of a nonlinear model of the brain's mean field dynamics. The model treats the cortex as a medium for the propagation of waves of electrical activity, incorporating key physiological processes such as propagation delays, membrane physiology, and corticothalamic feedback. Previous analyses have demonstrated its descriptive validity in a wide range of healthy states and yielded specific predictions with regards to seizure phenomena. We show that mapping the structure of the nonlinear bifurcation set predicts a number of crucial dynamic processes, including the onset of periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as multistability. Quantitative study of electrophysiological data supports the validity of these predictions. Hence, we argue that the core electrophysiological and cognitive differences between tonic-clonic and absence seizures are predicted and interrelated by the global bifurcation diagram of the model's dynamics. The present study is the first to present a unifying explanation of these generalized seizures using the bifurcation analysis of a dynamical model of the brain.},

To obtain a complete set of physiological measurements of sodium channel gating under identical conditions, and to facilitate comparison with previous work, comparison was made between currents recorded in the absence of extracellular divalent cations and in the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ (10 mM) and Mg2+ (50 mM). The single-channel currents were well resolved when divalent cations were not included in the extracellular solution, but were decreased in amplitude in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. The instantaneous current-voltage relationship obtained from macroscopic tail current measurements similarly was depressed by divalents, and showed a negative slope-conductance region for inward current at negative potentials. Voltage dependent parameters of channel gating were shifted 9-13 mV towards depolarized potentials by external divalent cations, including the peak fraction of channels open versus voltage, the time constant of tail current decline, the prepulse inactivation versus voltage relationship, and the charge-voltage relationship for gating currents. The effects of divalent cations are consistent with open channel block by Ca2+ and Mg2+ together with divalent screening of membrane charges.},

abstract = {Phospholipid bilayer membranes were bathed in a decimolar solution of monovalent ions, and the conductance produced by neutral carriers of these monovalent cations and anions was used to assess the electric potential at the surface of the membrane. When the bilayers were formed from a neutral lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, the addition of alkaline earth cations produced no detectable surface potential, indicating that little or no binding occurs to the polar head group with these ions. When the bilayers were formed from a negatively charged lipid, phosphatidylserine, the addition of Sr and Ba decreased the magnitude of the surface potential as predicted by the theory of the diffuse double layer. In particular, the potential decreased 27 mv for a 10-fold increase in concentration in the millimolar-decimolar range. A 10-fold increase in the Ca or Mg concentration also produced a 27 mv decrease in potential in this region, which was again due to screening, but it was necessary to invoke some specific binding to account for the observation that these cations were effective at a lower concentration than Ba or Sr. It is suggested that the ability of the alkaline earth cations to shift the conductance-voltage curves of a nerve along the voltage axis by 20-26 mv for a 10-fold increase in concentration may be due to essentially a screening rather than a binding phenomenon.},

Pairs of fluorescence images from the dye-stained membrane of neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells excited at two wavelengths were initially obtained to calculate ratio images corresponding to the resting transmembrane potential. Subsequently, a whole-cell patch was established and the membrane potential clamped to levels varying from -100 to +60 mV; at each voltage, a pair of dual-wavelength images were acquired to develop a calibration of the fluorescence ratio. Using this method, the resting potentials could accurately be measured showing that the differentiated cells were 17 mV more polarized than undifferentiated cells. The combination of electrical and optical methods can also follow changes in other membrane electric properties, such as dipole potential, and thus permit a detailed analysis of the membrane electrical properties underlying the voltage regulation of ion channels.},

Specifically, we calculated the molar partition coefficient, K (the reciprocal of the lipid concentration at which 1/2 the peptide is bound), of simple basic peptides (e.g., pentalysine) with phospholipid vesicles. The theoretical predictions agreed well with experimental measurements of the binding, but the agreement could have been fortuitous because the structure(s) of these flexible peptides is not known. Here we use the same theoretical approach to calculate the membrane binding of two small proteins of known structure: charybdotoxin (CTx) and iberiotoxin (IbTx); we also measure the binding of these proteins to phospholipid vesicles. The theoretical model describes accurately the dependence of K on the ionic strength and mol {\%} acidic lipid in the membrane for both CTx (net charge +4) and IbTx (net charge +2). For example, the theory correctly predicts that the value of K for the binding of CTx to a membrane containing 33{\%} acidic lipid should decrease by a factor of 10(5) when the salt concentration increases from 10 to 200 mM. We discuss the limitations of the theoretical approach and also consider a simple extension of the theory that incorporates nonpolar interactions.},

We find that the intramembrane potential gradient is indeed more positive in the membranes of neurites than in the membranes of somata.

abstract = {The cortical network recurrent circuitry generates spontaneous activity organized into Up (active) and Down (quiescent) states during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. These different states of cortical activation gain modulate synaptic transmission. However, the reported modulation that Up states impose on synaptic inputs is disparate in the literature, including both increases and decreases of responsiveness. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such disparate observations may depend on the intensity of the stimulation. By means of intracellular recordings, we studied synaptic transmission during Up and Down states in rat auditory cortex in vivo. Synaptic potentials were evoked either by auditory or electrical (thalamocortical, intracortical) stimulation while randomly varying the intensity of the stimulus. Synaptic potentials evoked by the same stimulus intensity were compared in Up/Down states. Up states had a scaling effect on the stimulus-evoked synaptic responses: the amplitude of weaker responses was potentiated whereas that of larger responses was maintained or decreased with respect to the amplitude during Down states. We used a computational model to explore the potential mechanisms explaining this nontrivial stimulus-response relationship. During Up/Down states, there is different excitability in the network and the neuronal conductance varies. We demonstrate that the competition between presynaptic recruitment and the changing conductance might be the central mechanism explaining the experimentally observed stimulus-response relationships. We conclude that the effect that cortical network activation has on synaptic transmission is not constant but contingent on the strength of the stimulation, with a larger modulation for stimuli involving both thalamic and cortical networks.},

The storage capacity of such networks has been quantified in two ways: the maximal number of patterns that can be stored, and the stored information measured in bits per synapse. In this paper, we compute both quantities in fully connected networks of N binary neurons with binary synapses, storing patterns with coding level [Formula: see text], in the large [Formula: see text] and sparse coding limits ([Formula: see text]). We also derive finite-size corrections that accurately reproduce the results of simulations in networks of tens of thousands of neurons. These methods are applied to three different scenarios: (1) the classic Willshaw model, (2) networks with stochastic learning in which patterns are shown only once (one shot learning), (3) networks with stochastic learning in which patterns are shown multiple times. The storage capacities are optimized over network parameters, which allows us to compare the performance of the different models. We show that finite-size effects strongly reduce the capacity, even for networks of realistic sizes. We discuss the implications of these results for memory storage in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {The processing speed of the brain depends on the ability of neurons to rapidly relay input changes. Previous theoretical and experimental studies of the timescale of population firing rate responses arrived at controversial conclusions, some advocating an ultrafast response scale but others arguing for an inherent disadvantage of mean encoded signals for rapid detection of the stimulus onset. Here we assessed the timescale of population firing rate responses of neocortical neurons in experiments performed in the time domain and the frequency domain in vitro and in vivo. We show that populations of neocortical neurons can alter their firing rate within 1 ms in response to somatically delivered weak current signals presented on a fluctuating background. Signals with amplitudes of miniature postsynaptic currents can be robustly and rapidly detected in the population firing. We further show that population firing rate of neurons of rat visual cortex in vitro and cat visual cortex in vivo can reliably encode weak signals varying at frequencies up to ∼200-300 Hz, or ∼50 times faster than the firing rate of individual neurons. These results provide coherent evidence for the ultrafast, millisecond timescale of cortical population responses. Notably, fast responses to weak stimuli are limited to the mean encoding. Rapid detection of current variance changes requires extraordinarily large signal amplitudes. Our study presents conclusive evidence showing that cortical neurons are capable of rapidly relaying subtle mean current signals. This provides a vital mechanism for the propagation of rate-coded information within and across brain areas.},

abstract = {The abilities of neuronal populations to encode rapidly varying stimuli and respond quickly to abrupt input changes are crucial for basic neuronal computations, such as coincidence detection, grouping by synchrony, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, as well as for the processing speed of neuronal networks. Theoretical analyses have linked these abilities to the fast-onset dynamics of action potentials (APs). Using a combination of whole-cell recordings from rat neocortical neurons and computer simulations, we provide the first experimental evidence for this conjecture and prove its validity for the case of distal AP initiation in the axon initial segment (AIS), typical for cortical neurons. Neocortical neurons with fast-onset APs in the soma can phase-lock their population firing to signal frequencies up to ∼300-400 Hz and respond within 1-2 ms to subtle changes of input current. The ability to encode high frequencies and response speed were dramatically reduced when AP onset was slowed by experimental manipulations or was intrinsically slow due to immature AP generation mechanisms. Multicompartment conductance-based models reproducing the initiation of spikes in the AIS could encode high frequencies only if AP onset was fast at the initiation site (e.g., attributable to cooperative gating of a fraction of sodium channels) but not when fast onset of somatic AP was produced solely by backpropagation. We conclude that fast-onset dynamics is a genuine property of cortical AP generators. It enables fast computations in cortical circuits that are rich in recurrent connections both within each region and across the hierarchy of areas.},

abstract = {It is not known whether the variability of neural activity in the cerebral cortex carries information or reflects noisy underlying mechanisms. In an examination of the reliability of spike generation using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information by the neocortex.},

abstract = {The study of several aspects of the collective dynamics of interacting neurons can be highly simplified if one assumes that the statistics of the synaptic input is the same for a large population of similarly behaving neurons (mean field approach). In particular, under such an assumption, it is possible to determine and study all the equilibrium points of the network dynamics when the neuronal response to noisy, in vivo-like, synaptic currents is known. The response function can be computed analytically for simple integrate-and-fire neuron models and it can be measured directly in experiments in vitro. Here we review theoretical and experimental results about the neural response to noisy inputs with stationary statistics. These response functions are important to characterize the collective neural dynamics that are proposed to be the neural substrate of working memory, decision making and other cognitive functions. Applications to the case of time-varying inputs are reviewed in a companion paper (Giugliano et al. in Biol Cybern, 2008). We conclude that modified integrate-and-fire neuron models are good enough to reproduce faithfully many of the relevant dynamical aspects of the neuronal response measured in experiments on real neurons in vitro.},

@article{Azouz2000,
abstract = {Cortical neurons are sensitive to the timing of their synaptic inputs. They can synchronize their firing on a millisecond time scale and follow rapid stimulus fluctuations with high temporal precision. These findings suggest that cortical neurons have an enhanced sensitivity to synchronous synaptic inputs that lead to rapid rates of depolarization. The voltage-gated currents underlying action potential generation may provide one mechanism to amplify rapid depolarizations. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the relations between membrane potential fluctuations and spike threshold in cat visual cortical neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo. We find that visual stimuli evoke broad variations in spike threshold that are caused in large part by an inverse relation between spike threshold and the rate of membrane depolarization preceding a spike. We also find that spike threshold is inversely related to the rate of rise of the action potential upstroke, suggesting that increases in spike threshold result from a decrease in the availability of Na(+) channels. By using a simple neuronal model, we show that voltage-gated Na(+) and K(+) conductances endow cortical neurons with an enhanced sensitivity to rapid depolarizations that arise from synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs. Thus, the basic mechanism responsible for action potential generation also enhances the sensitivity of cortical neurons to coincident synaptic inputs.},

@article{Baranauskas2010,
abstract = {Action potentials (APs) in the soma of central neurons exhibit a sharp, step-like onset dynamics, which facilitates the encoding of weak but rapidly changing input signals into trains of action potentials. One possibility to explain the rapid AP onset dynamics is to assume cooperative activation of sodium channels. However, there is no direct evidence for cooperativity of voltage gated sodium channels in central mammalian neurons. The fact that APs in cortical neurons are initiated in the axon and backpropagate into the soma, prompted an alternative explanation of the sharp onset of somatic APs. In the invasion scenario, the AP onset is smooth at the initiation site in the axon initial segment, but the current invading the soma before somatic sodium channels are activated produces a sharp onset of somatic APs. Here we used multicompartment neuron models to identify ranges of active and passive cell properties that are necessary to reproduce the sharp AP onset in the invasion scenario. Results of our simulations show that AP initiation in the axon is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the sharp onset of somatic AP: for a broad range of parameters, models could reproduce distal AP initiation and backpropagation but failed to quantitatively reproduce the onset dynamics of somatic APs observed in cortical neurons. To reproduce sharp onset of somatic APs, the invasion scenario required specific combinations of active and passive cell properties. The required properties of the axon initial segment differ significantly from the currently accepted and experimentally estimated values. We conclude that factors additional to the invasion contribute to the sharp AP onset and further experiments are needed to explain the AP onset dynamics in cortical neurons.},

abstract = {Spontaneous cortical activity--ongoing activity in the absence of intentional sensory input--has been studied extensively, using methods ranging from EEG (electroencephalography), through voltage sensitive dye imaging, down to recordings from single neurons. Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.},

abstract = {The response of a population of neurons to time-varying synaptic inputs can show a rich phenomenology, hardly predictable from the dynamical properties of the membrane's inherent time constants. For example, a network of neurons in a state of spontaneous activity can respond significantly more rapidly than each single neuron taken individually. Under the assumption that the statistics of the synaptic input is the same for a population of similarly behaving neurons (mean field approximation), it is possible to greatly simplify the study of neural circuits, both in the case in which the statistics of the input are stationary (reviewed in La Camera et al. in Biol Cybern, 2008) and in the case in which they are time varying and unevenly distributed over the dendritic tree. Here, we review theoretical and experimental results on the single-neuron properties that are relevant for the dynamical collective behavior of a population of neurons. We focus on the response of integrate-and-fire neurons and real cortical neurons to long-lasting, noisy, in vivo-like stationary inputs and show how the theory can predict the observed rhythmic activity of cultures of neurons. We then show how cortical neurons adapt on multiple time scales in response to input with stationary statistics in vitro. Next, we review how it is possible to study the general response properties of a neural circuit to time-varying inputs by estimating the response of single neurons to noisy sinusoidal currents. Finally, we address the dendrite-soma interactions in cortical neurons leading to gain modulation and spike bursts, and show how these effects can be captured by a two-compartment integrate-and-fire neuron. Most of the experimental results reviewed in this article have been successfully reproduced by simple integrate-and-fire model neurons.},

abstract = {In order to better understand the synaptic nature of the integration process operated by cortical neurons during sensory processing, it is necessary to devise quantitative methods which allow one to infer the level of conductance change evoked by the sensory stimulation and, consequently, the dynamics of the balance between excitation and inhibition. Such detailed measurements are required to characterize the static versus dynamic nature of the non-linear interactions triggered at the single cell level by sensory stimulus. This paper primarily reviews experimental data from our laboratory based on direct conductance measurements during whole-cell patch clamp recordings in two experimental preparations: (1) in vitro, during electrical stimulation in the visual cortex of the rat and (2) in vivo, during visual stimulation, in the primary visual cortex of the anaesthetized cat. Both studies demonstrate that shunting inhibition is expressed as well in vivo as in vitro. Our in vivo data reveals that a high level of diversity is observed in the degree of interaction (from linear to non-linear) and in the temporal interplay (from push-pull to synchronous) between stimulus-driven excitation (E) and inhibition (I). A detailed analysis of the E/I balance during evoked spike activity further shows that the firing strength results from a simultaneous decrease of evoked inhibition and increase of excitation. Secondary, the paper overviews the various computational methods used in the literature to assess conductance dynamics, measured in current clamp as well as in voltage clamp in different neocortical areas and species, and discuss the consistency of their estimations.},

abstract = {Neurons process and encode information by generating sequences of action potentials. For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding. Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials--their rapid initiation and variable onset potential--are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.},

We hypothesized that we can model the soma and its apical dendrite with only two compartments, without significant loss in the accuracy of spike-timing predictions. The model is based on experimentally measurable impulse-response functions, which transfer the effect of current injected in one compartment to current reaching the other. Each compartment was modeled with a pair of non-linear differential equations and a small number of parameters that approximate the Hodgkin-and-Huxley equations. The predictive power of this model was tested on electrophysiological experiments where noisy current was injected in both the soma and the apical dendrite simultaneously. We conclude that a simple two-compartment model can predict spike times of pyramidal cells stimulated in the soma and dendrites simultaneously. Our results support that regenerating activity in the apical dendritic is required to properly account for the dynamics of layer 5 pyramidal cells under in-vivo-like conditions.},

abstract = {Based on a reduced two-compartment model, the dynamical and biophysical mechanism underlying the spike initiation of the neuron to extracellular electric fields is investigated in this paper. With stability and phase plane analysis, we first investigate in detail the dynamical properties of neuronal spike initiation induced by geometric parameter and internal coupling conductance. The geometric parameter is the ratio between soma area and total membrane area, which describes the proportion of area occupied by somatic chamber. It is found that varying it could qualitatively alter the bifurcation structures of equilibrium as well as neuronal phase portraits, which remain unchanged when varying internal coupling conductance. By analyzing the activating properties of somatic membrane currents at subthreshold potentials, we explore the relevant biophysical basis of spike initiation dynamics induced by these two parameters. It is observed that increasing geometric parameter could greatly decrease the intensity of the internal current flowing from soma to dendrite, which switches spike initiation dynamics from Hopf bifurcation to SNIC bifurcation; increasing internal coupling conductance could lead to the increase of this outward internal current, whereas the increasing range is so small that it could not qualitatively alter the spike initiation dynamics. These results highlight that neuronal geometric parameter is a crucial factor in determining the spike initiation dynamics to electric fields. The finding is useful to interpret the functional significance of neuronal biophysical properties in their encoding dynamics, which could contribute to uncovering how neuron encodes electric field signals.},

@article{Wallach2011,
abstract = {Responses of individual neurons to ongoing input are highly variable, reflecting complex threshold dynamics. Experimental access to this threshold dynamics is required in order to fully characterize neuronal input-output relationships. The challenge is practically intractable using present day experimental paradigms due to the cumulative, non-linear interactions involved. Here we introduce the Neuronal Response Clamp, a closed-loop technique enabling control over the instantaneous response probability of the neuron. The potential of the technique is demonstrated by showing direct access to threshold dynamics of cortical neuron in vitro using extracellular recording and stimulation, over timescales ranging from seconds to many hours. Moreover, the method allowed us to expose the sensitivity of threshold dynamics to spontaneous input from the network in which the neuron is embedded. The Response-Clamp technique follows the rationale of the voltage-clamp and dynamic-clamp approaches, extending it to the neuron's spiking behavior. The general framework offered here is applicable in the study of other neural systems, beyond the single neuron level.},

@article{McLaughlin1970,
abstract = {Bilayer membranes, formed from various phospholipids, were studied to assess the influence of the charge of the polar head groups on the membrane conductance mediated by neutral "carriers" of cations and anions. The surface charge of an amphoteric lipid, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, was altered by varying the pH, and the surface charge of several lipids was screened by increasing the ionic strength of the solution with impermeant monovalent and divalent electrolytes. The surface charge should be a key parameter in defining the membrane conductance for a variety of permeation mechanisms; conductance measurements in the presence of carriers may be used to estimate the potential difference, due to surface charge, between the interior of the bilayer and the bulk aqueous phase. The large changes in conductance observed upon varying the surface charge density and the ionic strength agree with those predicted by the Gouy-Chapman theory for an aqueous diffuse double layer. Explicit expressions for the dependence of the membrane conductance on the concentrations of the carrier, the permeant ion, the surface charge density, and the ionic strength are presented.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses some of the basic considerations underlying the behavior of charged membranes in aqueous solutions. The chapter also describes the electrostatic interactions of membranes. After some general considerations of charged surfaces in liquids and the derivation of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation, the chapter presents specific solutions of several electrostatic problems starting with a single flat and rigid membrane, and then generalizing it to two flat membranes. Then, it considers the possibility of having a flexible membrane in various situations: a single membrane, two membranes, and a stack of membranes. Special emphasis is given to the coupling between the electrostatic and the elastic properties. By considering the membrane as a flexible (and homogeneous) interface, the contribution of the charges to the bending moduli has been found in various electrostatic regimes. Electrostatics tends to rigidify the membranes and also suppresses the out-of-plane fluctuations of a lamellar phase composed of a stack of membranes. However, when the membrane is heterogeneous, electrostatics can induce shape instabilities in relation to a lateral segregation of the two components.},

The latter is particularly interesting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic function of stimulus intensity. Finally, it is proved that the existence of limit cycle dynamics in response to one class of stimuli implies the existence of multiple stable states and hysteresis in response to a different class of stimuli. The relation between these findings and a number of experiments is discussed.},

@article{Kay2008,
abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

@article{Cohen2009,
abstract = {The sensitivity of a population of neurons, and therefore the amount of sensory information available to an animal, is limited by the sensitivity of single neurons in the population and by noise correlation between neurons. For decades, therefore, neurophysiologists have devised increasingly clever and rigorous ways to measure these critical variables (Parker and Newsome, 1998). Previous studies examining the relationship between the responses of single middle temporal (MT) neurons and direction-discrimination performance uncovered an apparent paradox. Sensitivity measurements from single neurons suggested that small numbers of neurons may account for a monkey's psychophysical performance (Britten et al., 1992), but trial-to-trial variability in activity of single MT neurons are only weakly correlated with the monkey's behavior, suggesting that the monkey's decision must be based on the responses of many neurons (Britten et al., 1996). We suggest that the resolution to this paradox lies (1) in the long stimulus duration used in the original studies, which led to an overestimate of neural sensitivity relative to psychophysical sensitivity, and (2) mistaken assumptions (because no data were available) about the level of noise correlation in MT columns with opposite preferred directions. We therefore made new physiological and psychophysical measurements in a reaction time version of the direction-discrimination task that matches neural measurements to the actual decision time of the animals. These new data, considered together with our recent data on noise correlation in MT (Cohen and Newsome, 2008), provide a substantially improved account of psychometric performance in the direction-discrimination task.},

The largest event in healthy human EEGs is the K-complex (KC), which occurs in slow-wave sleep. Here, we show that KCs are generated in widespread cortical areas by outward dendritic currents in the middle and upper cortical layers, accompanied by decreased broadband EEG power and decreased neuronal firing, which demonstrate a steep decline in network activity. Thus, KCs are isolated "down-states," a fundamental cortico-thalamic processing mode already characterized in animals. This correspondence is compatible with proposed contributions of the KC to sleep preservation and memory consolidation.},

Neuroengineering is providing new methods for tackling current difficulties; however neuroprosthetics have been studied for decades. Recent progresses are permitting the design of better systems with higher accuracies, repeatability, and system robustness. Bidirectional interfaces integrate recording and the relaying of information from and to the brain for the development of BCIs. The concepts of non-invasive and invasive recording of brain activity are introduced. This includes classical and innovative techniques like electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy. Then the problem of gliosis and solutions for (semi-) permanent implant biocompatibility such as innovative implant coatings, materials, and shapes are discussed. Implant power and the transmission of their data through implanted pulse generators and wireless telemetry are taken into account. How sensation can be relayed back to the brain to increase integration of the neuroengineered systems with the body by methods such as micro-stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are then addressed. The neuroprosthetic section discusses some of the various types and how they operate. Visual prosthetics are discussed and the three types, dependant on implant location, are examined. Auditory prosthetics, being cochlear or cortical, are then addressed. Replacement hand and limb prosthetics are then considered. These are followed by sections concentrating on the control of wheelchairs, computers and robotics directly from brain activity as recorded by non-invasive and invasive techniques.},

abstract = {Epilepsy affects more than 1{\%} of the world's population. Responsive neurostimulation is emerging as an alternative therapy for the 30{\%} of the epileptic patient population that does not benefit from pharmacological treatment. Efficient seizure detection algorithms will enable closed-loop epilepsy prostheses by stimulating the epileptogenic focus within an early onset window. Critically, this is expected to reduce neuronal desensitization over time and lead to longer-term device efficacy. This work presents a novel event-based seizure detection algorithm along with a low-power digital circuit implementation. Hippocampal depth-electrode recordings from six kainate-treated rats are used to validate the algorithm and hardware performance in this preliminary study. The design process illustrates crucial trade-offs in translating mathematical models into hardware implementations and validates statistical optimizations made with empirical data analyses on results obtained using a real-time functioning hardware prototype. Using quantitatively predicted thresholds from the depth-electrode recordings, the auto-updating algorithm performs with an average sensitivity and selectivity of 95.3 +/- 0.02{\%} and 88.9 +/- 0.01{\%} (mean +/- SE(alpha = 0.05)), respectively, on untrained data with a detection delay of 8.5 s [5.97, 11.04] from electrographic onset. The hardware implementation is shown feasible using CMOS circuits consuming under 350 nW of power from a 250 mV supply voltage from simulations on the MIT 180 nm SOI process.},

abstract = {Alterations of basal ganglia physiology in parkinsonism may consist of two elements, an increase in the firing rate of neurones and a change in the pattern of synchronisation of discharges between neurones. Recent findings suggest the presence of two principal modes of synchronised activity within the human subthalamo-pallidal-thalamo-cortical circuit, at {\textless}30 Hz and {\textgreater}60 Hz. These oscillations are dynamically and systematically modulated by task, thereby suggesting a functional role in movement. More importantly, the two frequency modes are inversely affected by movement, consistent with opposing actions, and differentially expressed according to the prevailing level of dopaminergic activity. It is argued that the balance between these modes determines the effects of basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections on the motor areas of the cortex. The lower frequency oscillations facilitate slow idling rhythms in the motor areas of the cortex, whereas synchronisation at high frequency restores dynamic task-related cortical ensemble activity in the gamma band.},

Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

abstract = {Under physiological and artificial conditions, the dendrites of neurons can be exposed to electric fields. Recent experimental studies suggested that the membrane resistivity of the distal apical dendrites of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons may be significantly lower than that of the proximal dendrites and the soma. To understand the behavior of dendrites in time-varying extracellular electric fields, we analytically solved cable equations for finite cylindrical cables with and without a leak conductance attached to one end by employing the Green's function method. The solution for a cable with a leak at one end for direct-current step electric fields shows a reversal in polarization at the leaky end, as has been previously shown by employing the separation of variables method and Fourier series expansion. The solution for a cable with a leak at one end for alternating-current electric fields reveals that the leaky end shows frequency preference in the response amplitude. Our results predict that a passive dendrite with low resistivity at the distal end would show frequency preference in response to sinusoidal extracellular local field potentials. The Green's function obtained in our study can be used to calculate response for any extracellular electric field.},

abstract = {The thalamus is the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex. While a single recipient cortical cell receives the convergence of many principal relay cells of the thalamus, each thalamic cell in turn integrates a dense and distributed synaptic feedback from the cortex. During sensory processing, the influence of this functional loop remains largely ignored. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a realistic hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway mixing biological cells and simulated circuits. The synaptic bombardment of cortical origin was mimicked through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells. The study of the impact of the simulated cortical input on the global retinocortical signal transfer efficiency revealed a novel control mechanism resulting from the collective resonance of all thalamic relay neurons. We show here that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment and iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. In particular, our results demonstrate counterintuitively that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. When applied to the intact brain, this network regulation mechanism could direct an attentional focus to specific thalamic subassemblies and select the appropriate input lines to the cortex according to the descending influence of cortically-defined "priors".},

@article{Nicoll1998,
abstract = {Sensory experience during an early critical period guides the development of thalamocortical circuits in many cortical areas. This process has been hypothesized to involve long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses. Here, we show that thalamocortical synapses in rat barrel cortex can express LTD, and that LTD is most readily induced during a developmental period that is similar to the critical period for thalamocortical plasticity in vivo. Thalamocortical LTD is homosynaptic and dependent on activation of N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The age-related decline of LTD is not due to changes in inhibition nor to changes in NMDA receptor voltage dependence. Minimal stimulation experiments indicate that, unlike thalamocortical LTP, thalamocortical LTD is not associated with a significant change in failure rate. The existence of LTD and its developmental time course suggest that LTD, like LTP, may contribute to the refinement of thalamocortical inputs in vivo.},

@article{Maass2002,
abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

abstract = {The neocortex generates periods of recurrent activity, such as the slow (0.1-0.5 Hz) oscillation during slow-wave sleep. Here we demonstrate that slices of ferret neocortex maintained in vitro generate this slow ({\textless} 1 Hz) rhythm when placed in a bathing medium that mimics the extracellular ionic composition in situ. This slow oscillation seems to be initiated in layer 5 as an excitatory interaction between pyramidal neurons and propagates through the neocortex. Our results demonstrate that the cerebral cortex generates an 'up' or depolarized state through recurrent excitation that is regulated by inhibitory networks, thereby allowing local cortical circuits to enter into temporarily activated and self-maintained excitatory states. The spontaneous generation and failure of this self-excited state may account for the generation of a subset of cortical rhythms during sleep.},

abstract = {We present a mathematical analysis of networks with integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with conductance based synapses. Taking into account the realistic fact that the spike time is only known within some finite precision, we propose a model where spikes are effective at times multiple of a characteristic time scale delta, where delta can be arbitrary small (in particular, well beyond the numerical precision). We make a complete mathematical characterization of the model-dynamics and obtain the following results. The asymptotic dynamics is composed by finitely many stable periodic orbits, whose number and period can be arbitrary large and can diverge in a region of the synaptic weights space, traditionally called the "edge of chaos", a notion mathematically well defined in the present paper. Furthermore, except at the edge of chaos, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the membrane potential trajectories and the raster plot. This shows that the neural code is entirely "in the spikes" in this case. As a key tool, we introduce an order parameter, easy to compute numerically, and closely related to a natural notion of entropy, providing a relevant characterization of the computational capabilities of the network. This allows us to compare the computational capabilities of leaky and IF models and conductance based models. The present study considers networks with constant input, and without time-dependent plasticity, but the framework has been designed for both extensions.},

The emphasis throughout is on fundamental concepts and relationships in the statistical theory of stationary random signals, explained in a concise, yet fairly rigorous presentation. Topics and Features: * Fourier series and transformsfundamentally important in random signal analysis and processingare developed from scratch, emphasizing the time- domain vs. frequency-domain duality. * Basic concepts of probability theory, laws of large numbers, the stability of fluctuations law (central limit theorem), and statistical parametric inference procedures are presented so that no prior knowledge of probability and statistics is required; the only prerequisite is a basic twothree semester calculus sequence. * Introduction of the fundamental concept of a stationary random signal and its autocorrelation structure. * Power spectra of stationary signals and transmission analysis. * Filter design with optimal signal-to-noise ratio. * Computer simulation algorithms of stationary random signals with a given power spectrum density. * Complementary bibliography for readers who wish to pursue the study of random signals in greater depth. * Many diverse examples as well as end-of-chapter problems and exercises. Developed by the author over the course of several years of classroom use, A First Course in Statistics for Signal Analysis may be used by junior/senior undergraduates or graduate students in electrical, systems, computer, and biomedical engineering, as well as the physical sciences.

While quiescent preparations exposed for 5 mins did not develop delayed afterdepolarizations, those placed in the test solution for 30 mins with or without stimulation developed afterdepolarizations. Changes occurring during a short exposure to low K+, high Ca2+ solution were increases in membrane resistance, membrane time constant and space constant by 47{\%}, 83{\%} and 17{\%} compared with the control, respectively. There were no significant changes in internal longitudinal resistance and membrane capacity. During long exposure to the test solution (30 mins), delayed afterdepolarizations developed. There were similar increases in membrane resistance and in time constant as found during the short exposures. Internal longitudinal resistance was calculated to have increased by 24{\%} during the long exposure. A 19{\%} increase in membrane capacity was also found during the test condition. High Ca2+ or low K+ alone did not cause a significant increase in internal longitudinal resistance. The conduction velocity in the longitudinal direction decreased from 107 +/- 23 cm/s during the control to 80 +/- 7 cm/s during the test period for 30 mins. These results suggest that, in addition to the abnormal impulse formation based on afterdepolarizations, low K+, high Ca2+ solution changes the passive electrical properties of the fibers, resulting in a lower rate of impulse conduction.},

abstract = {1. Simultaneous dendritic and somatic patch-clamp recordings were made from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices from 12- to 21-day-old rats. Voltage responses to current impulses injected via either the dendritic or the somatic pipette were obtained in the presence of the selective I(h) blocker ZD 7288 and blockers of spontaneous synaptic input. Neurons were filled with biocytin for subsequent morphological reconstruction. 2. Four neurons were reconstructed and converted into detailed compartmental models. The specific membrane capacitance (C(m)), specific membrane resistance (R(m)) and intracellular resistivity (R(i)) were optimized by direct fitting of the model responses to the electrophysiological data from the same cell. Mean values were: C(m), 0.77 +/- 0.17 microF cm(-2) (mean +/- S.D.; range, 0.64-1.00 microF cm(-2)), R(m), 122 +/- 18 kOmega cm(2) (98-141 kOmega cm(2)) and R(i), 115 +/- 20 Omega cm (93-142 Omega cm). 3. The steady-state electrotonic architecture of these cells was compact under the experimental conditions used. However, somatic voltage-clamp recordings of parallel fibre and climbing fibre synaptic currents were substantially filtered and attenuated. 4. The detailed models were compared with a two-compartment model of Purkinje cells. The range of synaptic current kinetics that can be faithfully recorded using somatic voltage clamp is predicted fairly well by the two-compartment model, even though some of its underlying assumptions are violated. 5. A model of I(h) was constructed based on voltage-clamp data, and inserted into the passive compartmental models. Somatic EPSP amplitude was substantially attenuated compared to the amplitude of dendritic EPSPs at their site of generation. However, synaptic efficacy of the same quantal synaptic conductance, as measured by the somatic EPSP amplitude, was only weakly dependent on synaptic location on spiny branchlets. 6. The passive electrotonic structure of Purkinje cells is unusual in that the steady-state architecture is very compact, while voltage transients such as synaptic potentials and action potentials are heavily filtered.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical oscillations mediate both physiological and pathophysiological behaviors including sleep and generalized absence epilepsy (GA). Reciprocal intrathalamic circuitry and robust burst firing, dependent on underlying transient Ca current (IT) in thalamic neurons, support generation of such rhythms. In order to study the regulation of intrathalamic rhythm generation and the effects of GA anticonvulsants previously shown to reduce IT in acutely isolated thalamic neurons, we developed an in vitro rat thalamic slice preparation that retains sufficient intrathalamic circuitry to support evoked oscillations (range = 2.0-4.6 Hz, average = 2.7, n = 38), associated with burst firing in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) and thalamic relay neurons. Extracellular stimulation of nRt evoked in relay neurons a biphasic inhibitory response with prominent GABAA and GABAB receptor-mediated components. The GABAA component was picrotoxin sensitive, outwardly rectifying and Cl- dependent, with a very negative reversal potential (-94 mV), indicating that an active extrusion mechanism exists in these cells to keep [Cl-]i {\textless} 5 mM. The GABAB component had a linear conductance, a reversal potential of -103 mV, and was quite long lasting (about 300 msec) so that rebound bursts often were generated on its decay phase, presumably leading to reexcitation of nRt through known excitatory connections. GABAB-mediated responses thus provide a timing mechanism for promoting slow intrathalamic oscillations. Reduction of IT (30-40{\%}) by succinimides slightly increased the threshold for burst generation in relay and nRt cells, but there was little effect on either number of spikes/burst or intraburst frequency, and there were no other direct effects on other measures of cellular excitability. Intrathalamic oscillations were significantly reduced by these agents through a slight decrease in burst probability of thalamic neurons. We conclude that interactions between the intrinsic properties of thalamic neurons and intrathalamic circuitry lead to generation of slow oscillations. A similar mechanism may underlie the pathophysiological 3 Hz spike and wave EEG activity that characterizes GA. Furthermore, anti-GA drugs such as ethosuximide probably exert their action by reducing the burst-firing probability of neurons within populations of reciprocally interconnected relay and nRt neurons, thus producing a desynchronization of the thalamic circuit that prevents spike/wave generation.},

abstract = {Although the neocortex forms a distributed system comprised of several functional areas, its vertical columnar organization is largely conserved across areas and species, suggesting the existence of a canonical neocortical microcircuit. In order to elucidate the principles governing the organization of such a cortical diagram, a detailed understanding of the dynamics binding different types of cortical neurons into a coherent algorithm is essential. Within this complex circuitry, GABAergic interneurons, while forming approximately only 15-20{\%} of all cortical neurons, appear critical in maintaining a dynamic balance between excitation and inhibition. Despite their importance, cortical GABAergic neurons have not been extensively studied in vivo and their precise role in shaping the local microcircuit sensory response still remains to be determined. Their paucity, combined with their molecular, anatomical, and physiological diversity, has made it difficult to even establish a consensual nomenclature. However, recent technological advances in microscopy and mouse genetics have fostered a renewed interest in neocortical interneurons by putting them within "visible" reach of experimenters. The anatomically well-defined whisker-to-barrel pathway of the rodent is particularly amenable to studies attempting to link cortical circuit dynamics to behavior. To each whisker corresponds a discrete cortical unit equivalent to a single column, specialized in the encoding and processing of the sensory information it receives. In this review, we will focus on the functional role that each subtype of supragranular GABAergic neuron embedded within such a single neocortical unit may play in shaping the dynamics of the local circuit during somatosensory integration.},

abstract = {Population spikes vary in size during prolonged epileptic ("ictal") discharges, indicating variations in neuronal synchronization. Here we investigate the role of changes in tissue electrical resistivity in this process. We used the rat hippocampal slice, low-Ca(2+) model of epilepsy and measured changes in pyramidal layer extracellular resistance during the course of electrographic seizures. During each burst, population spike frequency decreased, whereas amplitude and spatial synchronization increased; after the main discharge, there could be brief secondary discharges that, in contrast with those in the primary discharge, started with high-amplitude population spikes. Mean resistivity increased from 1,231 Omega.cm immediately before the burst to a maximum of 1,507 Omega.cm during the burst. There was no significant increase during the first 0.5-1 s of the field burst, but resistance then increased (tau approximately 5 s), reaching its peak at the end of the burst, and then decayed slowly (tau approximately 10 s). In further experiments, we modulated the efficacy of electrical field effects by changing perfusate osmolarity. Reducing osmolarity by 40-70 mOsm increased preburst resistivity by 19{\%}; it reduced minimum population spike frequency (x0.6-0.7) and increased both maximum population spike amplitude (x1.5-2.3) and spatial synchronization (x1.4-2.5, cross-correlation over 0.5 mm) during bursts. Increasing osmolarity by 20-40 mOsm had the opposite effects. These results suggest that, during each field burst, field effects between neurons gradually become more effective as cells swell, thereby modulating burst dynamics and facilitating the rapid synchronization of secondary discharges.},

abstract = {There is compelling evidence that sleep contributes to the long-term consolidation of new memories. This function of sleep has been linked to slow ({\textless}1 Hz) potential oscillations, which predominantly arise from the prefrontal neocortex and characterize slow wave sleep. However, oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks, which links the membrane and synaptic processes of these neurons in time. Whether brain potentials and their extracellular equivalent have any physiological meaning per se is unclear, but can easily be investigated by inducing the extracellular oscillating potential fields of interest. Here we show that inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans. The slowly oscillating potential stimulation induced an immediate increase in slow wave sleep, endogenous cortical slow oscillations and slow spindle activity in the frontal cortex. Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz--another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep--decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged. Our findings indicate that endogenous slow potential oscillations have a causal role in the sleep-associated consolidation of memory, and that this role is enhanced by field effects in cortical extracellular space.},

abstract = {Synaptically generated subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) fluctuations can be characterized within the framework of stochastic calculus. It is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the steady-state Vm distribution, even in the case of conductance-based synaptic currents. However, as we show here, the analytic expressions obtained may substantially deviate from numerical solutions if the stochastic membrane equations are solved exclusively based on expectation values of differentials of the stochastic variables, hence neglecting the spectral properties of the underlying stochastic processes. We suggest a simple solution that corrects these deviations, leading to extended analytic expressions of the Vm distribution valid for a parameter regime that covers several orders of magnitude around physiologically realistic values. These extended expressions should enable finer characterization of the stochasticity of synaptic currents by analyzing experimentally recorded Vm distributions and may be applicable to other classes of stochastic processes as well.},

abstract = {The recurrent excitatory and inhibitory connections between and within layers of the cerebral cortex are fundamental to the operation of local cortical circuits. Models of cortical function often assume that recurrent excitation and inhibition are balanced, and we recently demonstrated that spontaneous network activity in vitro contains a precise balance of excitation and inhibition; however, the existence of a balance between excitation and inhibition in the intact and spontaneously active cerebral cortex has not been directly tested. We examined this hypothesis in the prefrontal cortex in vivo, during the slow ({\textless}1 Hz) oscillation in ketamine-xylazine-anesthetized ferrets. We measured persistent network activity (Up states) with extracellular multiple unit and local field potential recording, while simultaneously recording synaptic currents in nearby cells. We determined the reversal potential and conductance change over time during Up states and found that the body of Up state activity exhibited a steady reversal potential (-37 mV on average) for hundreds of milliseconds, even during substantial (21 nS on average) changes in membrane conductance. Furthermore, we found that both the initial and final segments of the Up state were characterized by significantly more depolarized reversal potentials and concomitant increases in excitatory conductance, compared with the stable middle portions of Up states. This ongoing temporal evolution between excitation and inhibition, which exhibits remarkable proportionality within and across neurons in active local networks, may allow for rapid transitions between relatively stable network states, permitting the modulation of neuronal responsiveness in a behaviorally relevant manner.},

abstract = {Population rate or activity equations are the foundation of a common approach to modeling for neural networks. These equations provide mean field dynamics for the firing rate or activity of neurons within a network given some connectivity. The shortcoming of these equations is that they take into account only the average firing rate, while leaving out higher-order statistics like correlations between firing. A stochastic theory of neural networks that includes statistics at all orders was recently formulated. We describe how this theory yields a systematic extension to population rate equations by introducing equations for correlations and appropriate coupling terms. Each level of the approximation yields closed equations; they depend only on the mean and specific correlations of interest, without an ad hoc criterion for doing so. We show in an example of an all-to-all connected network how our system of generalized activity equations captures phenomena missed by the mean field rate equations alone.},

abstract = {Populations of neurons in the retina, olfactory system, visual and somatosensory thalamus, and several cortical regions show temporal correlation between the discharge times of their action potentials (spike trains). Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding, attention, stimulus discrimination, and motor behaviour. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood, and its coding implications are still debated. It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate-and-fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold-linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.},

abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Slices of sensorimotor and anterior cingulate cortex from guinea pigs were maintained in vitro and bathed in a normal physiological medium. Electrophysiological properties of neurons were assessed with intracellular recording techniques. Some neurons were identified morphologically by intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH. Three distinct neuronal classes of electrophysiological behavior were observed; these were termed regular spiking, bursting, and fast spiking. The physiological properties of neurons from sensorimotor and anterior cingulate areas did not differ significantly. Regular-spiking cells were characterized by action potentials with a mean duration of 0.80 ms at one-half amplitude, a ratio of maximum rate of spike rise to maximum rate of fall of 4.12, and a prominent afterhyperpolarization following a train of spikes. The primary slope of initial spike frequency versus injected current intensity was 241 Hz/nA. During prolonged suprathreshold current pulses the frequency of firing adapted strongly. When local synaptic pathways were activated, all cells were transiently excited and then strongly inhibited. Bursting cells were distinguished by their ability to generate endogenous, all-or-none bursts of three to five action potentials. Their properties were otherwise very similar to regular-spiking cells. The ability to generate a burst was eliminated when the membrane was depolarized to near the firing threshold with tonic current. By contrast, hyperpolarization of regular-spiking (i.e., nonbursting) cells did not uncover latent bursting tendencies. The action potentials of fast-spiking cells were much briefer (mean of 0.32 ms) than those of the other cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

@article{Fourcaud-Trocme2003,
abstract = {This study examines the ability of neurons to track temporally varying inputs, namely by investigating how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron is modulated by a noisy input with a small sinusoidal component with frequency (f). Using numerical simulations of conductance-based neurons and analytical calculations of one-variable nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons, we characterized the dependence of this modulation on f. For sufficiently high noise, the neuron acts as a low-pass filter. The modulation amplitude is approximately constant for frequencies up to a cutoff frequency, fc, after which it decays. The cutoff frequency increases almost linearly with the firing rate. For higher frequencies, the modulation amplitude decays as C/falpha, where the power alpha depends on the spike initiation mechanism. For conductance-based models, alpha = 1, and the prefactor C depends solely on the average firing rate and a spike "slope factor," which determines the sharpness of the spike initiation. These results are attributable to the fact that near threshold, the sodium activation variable can be approximated by an exponential function. Using this feature, we propose a simplified one-variable model, the "exponential integrate-and-fire neuron," as an approximation of a conductance-based model. We show that this model reproduces the dynamics of a simple conductance-based model extremely well. Our study shows how an intrinsic neuronal property (the characteristics of fast sodium channels) determines the speed with which neurons can track changes in input.},

abstract = {The location and trajectory of seizure activity is of great importance, yet our ability to map such activity remains primitive. Recently, the development of multi-electrode arrays for use in humans has provided new levels of temporal and spatial resolution for recording seizures. Here, we show that there is a sharp delineation between areas showing intense, hypersynchronous firing indicative of recruitment to the seizure, and adjacent territories where there is only low-level, unstructured firing. Thus, there is a core territory of recruited neurons and a surrounding 'ictal penumbra'. The defining feature of the 'ictal penumbra' is the contrast between the large amplitude EEG signals and the low-level firing there. Our human recordings bear striking similarities with animal studies of an inhibitory restraint, indicating that they can be readily understood in terms of this mechanism. These findings have important implications for how we localize seizure activity and map its spread.},

abstract = {Neuronal response properties are typically probed by intracellular measurements of current-voltage (I-V) relationships during application of current or voltage steps. Here we demonstrate the measurement of a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a fluctuating voltage and emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to repeated stimuli.},

abstract = {In a previous paper (Rudolph {\&} Destexhe, 2006), we proposed various models, the gIF neuron models, of analytical integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with conductance-based (COBA) dynamics for use in event-driven simulations. These models are based on an analytical approximation of the differential equation describing the IF neuron with exponential synaptic conductances and were successfully tested with respect to their response to random and oscillating inputs. Because they are analytical and mathematically simple, the gIF models are best suited for fast event-driven simulation strategies. However, the drawback of such models is they rely on a nonrealistic postsynaptic potential (PSP) time course, consisting of a discontinuous jump followed by a decay governed by the membrane time constant. Here, we address this limitation by conceiving an analytical approximation of the COBA IF neuron model with the full PSP time course. The subthreshold and suprathreshold response of this gIF4 model reproduces remarkably well the postsynaptic responses of the numerically solved passive membrane equation subject to conductance noise, while gaining at least two orders of magnitude in computational performance. Although the analytical structure of the gIF4 model is more complex than that of its predecessors due to the necessity of calculating future spike times, a simple and fast algorithmic implementation for use in large-scale neural network simulations is proposed.},

The hypothesis that the temporal variability in the firing of a neuron results from an approximate balance between its excitatory and inhibitory inputs was investigated theoretically. Such a balance emerges naturally in large networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations that are sparsely connected by relatively strong synapses. The resulting state is characterized by strongly chaotic dynamics, even when the external inputs to the network are constant in time. Such a network exhibits a linear response, despite the highly nonlinear dynamics of single neurons, and reacts to changing external stimuli on time scales much smaller than the integration time constant of a single neuron.},

abstract = {Inhibition of irrelevant information (conflict monitoring) and/or of prepotent actions is an essential component of adaptive self-organized behavior. Neural dynamics underlying these functions has been studied in humans using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited in Go/NoGo tasks that require a speeded motor response to the Go stimuli and withholding a prepotent response when a NoGo stimulus is presented. However, averaged ERP waveforms provide only limited information about the neuronal mechanisms underlying stimulus processing, motor preparation, and response production or inhibition. In this study, we examine the cortical representation of conflict monitoring and response inhibition using time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during continuous performance Go/NoGo task in 50 young adult females. We hypothesized that response inhibition would be associated with a transient boost in both temporal and spatial synchronization of prefrontal cortical activity, consistent with the role of the anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices in cognitive control. Overall, phase synchronization across trials measured by Phase Locking Index and phase synchronization between electrode sites measured by Phase Coherence were the highest in the Go and NoGo conditions, intermediate in the Warning condition, and the lowest under Neutral condition. The NoGo condition was characterized by significantly higher fronto-central synchronization in the 300-600 ms window, whereas in the Go condition, delta- and theta-band synchronization was higher in centro-parietal regions in the first 300 ms after the stimulus onset. The present findings suggest that response production and inhibition is supported by dynamic functional networks characterized by distinct patterns of temporal and spatial synchronization of brain oscillations.},

abstract = {A literature review reveals many lines of evidence that both delayed rectifier and inward rectifier potassium channels are multi-ion pores. These include unidirectional flux ratios given by the 2--2.5 power of the electrochemical activity ratio, very steeply voltage-dependent block with monovalent blocking ions, relief of block by permeant ions added to the side opposite from the blocking ion, rectification depending on E--EK, and a minimum in the reversal potential or conductance as external K+ ions are replaced by an equivalent concentration of T1+ ions. We consider a channel with a linear sequence of energy barriers and binding sites. The channel can be occupied by more than one ion at a time, and ions hop in single file into vacant sites with rate constants that depend on barrier heights, membrane potential, and interionic repulsion. Such multi-ion models reproduce qualitatively the special flux properties of potassium channels when the barriers for hopping out of the pore are larger than for hopping between sites within the pore and when there is repulsion between ions. These conditions also produce multiple maxima in the conductance-ion activity relationship. In agreement with Armstrong's hypothesis (1969. J. Gen. Physiol. 54:553--575), inward rectification may be understood in terms of block by an internal blocking cation. Potassium channels must have at least three sites and often contain at least two ions at a time.},

abstract = {Depending on the connectivity, recurrent networks of simple computational units can show very different types of dynamics, ranging from totally ordered to chaotic. We analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a time-varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution of the connectivity matrix. In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.},

abstract = {The electrochemical processes that underlie neural function manifest themselves in ceaseless spatiotemporal field fluctuations. However, extracellular fields feed back onto the electric potential across the neuronal membrane via ephaptic coupling, independent of synapses. The extent to which such ephaptic coupling alters the functioning of neurons under physiological conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we stimulated and recorded from rat cortical pyramidal neurons in slices with a 12-electrode setup. We found that extracellular fields induced ephaptically mediated changes in the somatic membrane potential that were less than 0.5 mV under subthreshold conditions. Despite their small size, these fields could strongly entrain action potentials, particularly for slow ({\textless}8 Hz) fluctuations of the extracellular field. Finally, we simultaneously measured from up to four patched neurons located proximally to each other. Our findings indicate that endogenous brain activity can causally affect neural function through field effects under physiological conditions.},

abstract = {1. Glass microelectrodes were used to record extracellular responses from 308 SI cortical neurons to deflections of the contralateral vibrissae in 21 unanesthetized, paralyzed rats. Controlled deflections of individual hairs were produced by means of an electromechanical stimulator. Fast green dye marks were made to aid histological reconstructions of electrode tracks. 2. TS) were observed throughout layers II--VI; "fast" cortical spikes (FS) were less frequently encountered and largely restricted to layer IV. Although both types of potentials had similar negative-positive waveforms. FSs were distinguished from RSs by their comparatively rapid time course, about half that of RSs. RS units (RSU) discharged spontaneously at rates of less than 1--15/s, whereas FS units (FSU) displayed rates of 15--50/s. The amplitudes of FSs, which were generally smaller than those of RSs, often decreased during high-frequency discharges. 3. With sinusoidal oscillations of a vibrissa FSUs responded more reliably and over a broader range of frequencies (3 to at least 40 Hz) than did RSUs , particularly in layer IV. In addition, FSUs typically responded to whisker deflections over a range of 360 degrees, whereas many RSUs in layer IV displayed sharp spatial-tuning charcteristics, responding over a restricted range of less than 90 degrees. 4. Of all units, 58{\%} responded preferentially to stimulus transients (vibrissal movements), 32{\%} displayed sustained responses to stimulus stead-states (fixed vibrissal displacement). For the remaining 10{\%} of units the appropriate stimulus could not be specified; these units were particularly common in layer V. 5. Computation of quantitative stimulus-response relations showed that many units increased their rate of discharge with increasing stimulus intensities. 6. Most units were directionally selective, responding preferentially to deflections of a whisker in one or more of four quadrants. 7. In radial penetrations through the cortex there was a columnar patern so that units were activated at least by the same (i.e., the "principal") whisker. In a number of cases these could be directly correlated with the barrels. Of all units, 55{\%} responded to deflections of single vibrissa only, the remaining 45{\%} to 2--12 adjacently situated vibrissae. For most multiple-whiser units the responses elicited by deflection of any one hair activating the neuron was qualitatively similar to those elicited by deflection of any other hair activating it. The principal whisker of the penetration was typically associated with the most vigorous responses. 8. In layer IV, 85{\%} of neurons responded to deflections of one hair only, the remaining 15{\%} to two or more hairs. In layers II and III 39{\%} of units were activated by more than one vibrissa; in layers V and VI multiple-whisker units predominated (64{\%}). Whisker configurations in the deep layers were larger than those in other layers. 9...},

abstract = {Mathematical solutions and numerical illustrations are presented for the steady-state distribution of membrane potential in an extensively branched neuron model, when steady electric current is injected into only one dendritic branch. Explicit expressions are obtained for input resistance at the branch input site and for voltage attenuation from the input site to the soma; expressions for AC steady-state input impedance and attenuation are also presented. The theo- retical model assumes passive membrane properties and the equivalent cylinder constraint on branch diameters. Numerical examples illustrate how branch input resistance and steady attenuation depend upon the following: the number of den- dritic trees, the orders of dendritic branching, the electrotonic length of the den- dritic trees, the location of the dendritic input site, and the input resistance at the soma. The application to cat spinal motoneurons, and to other neuron types, is discussed. The effect of a large dendritic input resistance upon the amount of local membrane depolarization at the synaptic site, and upon the amount of depolar- ization reaching the soma, is illustrated and discussed; simple proportionality with input resistance does not hold, in general. Also, branch input resistance is shown to exceed the input resistance at the soma by an amount that is always less than the sum of core resistances along the path from the input site to the soma.},

abstract = {Many efforts have been devoted to modeling asynchronous irregular (AI) activity states, which resemble the complex activity states seen in the cerebral cortex of awake animals. Most of models have considered balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons in which AI states are sustained through recurrent sparse connectivity, with or without external input. In this letter we propose a mesoscopic description of such AI states. Using master equation formalism, we derive a second-order mean-field set of ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of randomly connected balanced networks. This formalism takes into account finite size effects and is applicable to any neuron model as long as its transfer function can be characterized. We compare the predictions of this approach with numerical simulations for different network configurations and parameter spaces. Considering the randomly connected network as a unit, this approach could be used to build large-scale networks of such connected units, with an aim to model activity states constrained by macroscopic measurements, such as voltage-sensitive dye imaging.},

abstract = {Excitatory synaptic activity in the brain is shaped and balanced by inhibition. Because inhibition cannot propagate, it is often recruited with a synaptic delay by incoming excitation. Cerebellar Purkinje cells are driven by long-range excitatory parallel fiber inputs, which also recruit local inhibitory basket cells. The axon initial segment of each Purkinje cell is ensheathed by basket cell axons in a structure called the pinceau, which is largely devoid of chemical synapses. In mice, we found at the single-cell level that the pinceau mediates ephaptic inhibition of Purkinje cell firing at the site of spike initiation. The reduction of firing rate was synchronous with the presynaptic action potential, eliminating a synaptic delay and allowing granule cells to inhibit Purkinje cells without a preceding phase of excitation. Axon-axon ephaptic intercellular signaling can therefore mediate near-instantaneous feedforward and lateral inhibition.},

abstract = {Local field potentials and the underlying endogenous electric fields (EFs) are traditionally considered to be epiphenomena of structured neuronal network activity. Recently, however, externally applied EFs have been shown to modulate pharmacologically evoked network activity in rodent hippocampus. In contrast, very little is known about the role of endogenous EFs during physiological activity states in neocortex. Here, we used the neocortical slow oscillation in vitro as a model system to show that weak sinusoidal and naturalistic EFs enhance and entrain physiological neocortical network activity with an amplitude threshold within the range of in vivo endogenous field strengths. Modulation of network activity by positive and negative feedback fields based on the network activity in real-time provide direct evidence for a feedback loop between neuronal activity and endogenous EF. This significant susceptibility of active networks to EFs that only cause small changes in membrane potential in individual neurons suggests that endogenous EFs could guide neocortical network activity.},

@article{Koch1990,
abstract = {A recent report has provided evidence that there are no significant increases in the neuronal input conductance during the response of cortical cells in cat visual cortex to non-preferred visual stimuli (Douglas et al., 1988). A criticism of experiments of this kind is that changes in the membrane conductance occurring in the dendritic tree may not be visible from electrodes that impale the soma. Our paper describes theoretical and numerical results concerning the visibility of synaptically induced conductance changes from intracellular electrodes, in both ideal and anatomically well-characterized cortical neurons. Based on earlier work by Rall (1967), we here derive theoretical expressions for the change in input conductance at any location in a passive dendritic tree resulting from activation of a single synapse and obtain bounds for the effects of multiple synapses. We find that the conductance change measured at the cell body is always less than the sum of the synaptic conductance changes and that this observed conductance change does not depend on the synaptic reversal potential. For the case of an infinite dendritic cylinder, the change in input resistance due to a single synaptic input decays exponentially with distance of the synapse from the recording site. Numerical simulations of synaptic inputs that change approximately as fast as the membrane time-constant produce an increase in input conductance that is only slightly less visible than that of a constant input. We also compute the changes in somatic input conductance of 2 morphologically identified pyramidal cells from cat visual cortex during activity of a single inhibitory basket cell with known synaptic input locations. We find that the increase in conductance due to the activity of the inhibitory basket cells is clearly visible from the cell body of the pyramidal cells and that a 70{\%} reduction in the amplitude of excitation is associated with at least a 30{\%} increase in somatic input conductance, which would be visible in intracellular recordings. Taken together with the negative experimental evidence of Douglas et al. (1988), our results cast doubt on a large class of models of direction selectivity that rely on synaptically mediated inhibitory conductance increases to veto or block excitatory conductances increases.},

@article{Ibarz2010a,
abstract = {Fast ripples are a type of transient high-frequency oscillations recorded from the epileptogenic regions of the hippocampus and the temporal cortex of epileptic humans and rodents. These events presumably reflect hypersynchronous bursting of pyramidal cells. However, the oscillatory spectral content of fast ripples varies from 250 to 800 Hz, well above the maximal firing frequency of most hippocampal pyramidal neurons. How such high-frequency oscillations are generated is therefore unclear. Here, we combine computational simulations of fast ripples with multisite and juxtacellular recordings in vivo to examine the underlying mechanisms in the hippocampus of epileptic rats. We show that populations of bursting cells firing individually at 100-400 Hz can create fast ripples according to two main firing regimes: (1) in-phase synchronous firing resulting in "pure" fast ripples characterized by single spectral peaks that reflect single-cell behavior and (2) out-of-phase firing that results in "emergent" fast ripples. Using simulations, we found that fast ripples generated under these two different regimes can be quantitatively separated by their spectral characteristics, and we took advantage of this separability to examine their dynamics in vivo. We found that in-phase firing can reach frequencies up to 300 Hz in the CA1 and up to 400 Hz in the dentate gyrus. The organization of out-of-phase firing is determined by firing delays between cells discharging at low frequencies. The two firing regimes compete dynamically, alternating randomly from one fast ripple event to the next, and they reflect the functional dynamic organization of the different regions of the hippocampus.},

abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, INa; a persistent, depolarization-activated Na+ current, INap; a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high-threshold Ca2+ current, IL; a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, IC; a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, IA; a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, IK2; a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih; and K+ and Na+ leak currents IKleak and INaleak. 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, IKleak and INaleak, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of IA resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of IK2, or IL combined with IC, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of IT resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of INap resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), IL, IA, IC, and IK2. The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike. The transient K+ current IA slowed the rate of rise and reduced the peak amplitude of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike, whereas the slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 contributed greatly to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Activation of IL during the peak of the Ca2+ spike led to activation of IC, which also contributed to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of any one of the K+ currents resulted in an increase in the other two, thereby resulting in substantially smaller changes in the Ca2+ spike than would be expected on the basis of the amplitude of each ionic current alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {To understand the mechanisms of fast information processing in the brain, it is necessary to determine how rapidly populations of neurons can respond to incoming stimuli in a noisy environment. Recently, it has been shown experimentally that an ensemble of neocortical neurons can track a time-varying input current in the presence of additive correlated noise very fast, up to frequencies of several hundred hertz. Modulations in the firing rate of presynaptic neuron populations affect, however, not only the mean but also the variance of the synaptic input to postsynaptic cells. It has been argued that such modulations of the noise intensity (multiplicative modulation) can be tracked much faster than modulations of the mean input current (additive modulation). Here, we compare the response characteristics of an ensemble of neocortical neurons for both modulation schemes. We injected sinusoidally modulated noisy currents (additive and multiplicative modulation) into layer V pyramidal neurons of the rat somatosensory cortex and measured the trial and ensemble-averaged spike responses for a wide range of stimulus frequencies. For both modulation paradigms, we observed low-pass behavior. The cutoff frequencies were markedly high, considerably higher than the average firing rates. We demonstrate that modulations in the variance can be tracked significantly faster than modulations in the mean input. Extremely fast stimuli (up to 1 kHz) can be reliably tracked, provided the stimulus amplitudes are sufficiently high.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of brain tissue to weak extracellular electric fields is important in assessing potential public health risks of extremely low frequency (ELF) fields, and potential roles of endogenous fields in brain function. Here we determine the effect of applied electric fields on membrane potentials and coherent network oscillations. Applied DC electric fields change transmembrane potentials in CA3 pyramidal cell somata by 0.18 mV per V m(-1) applied. AC sinusoidal electric fields have smaller effects on transmembrane potentials: sensitivity drops as an exponential decay function of frequency. At 50 and 60 Hz it is approximately 0.4 that for DC fields. Effects of fields of {\textless} or = 16 V m(-1) peak-to-peak (p-p) did not outlast application. Kainic acid (100 nm) induced coherent network oscillations in the beta and gamma bands (15-100 Hz). Applied fields of {\textgreater} or = 6 V m(-1) p-p (2.1 V m(-1) r.m.s.) shifted the gamma peak in the power spectrum to centre on the applied field frequency or a subharmonic. Statistically significant effects on the timing of pyramidal cell firing within the oscillation appeared at distinct thresholds: at 50 Hz, 1 V m(-1) p-p (354 mV m(-1) r.m.s.) had statistically significant effects in 71{\%} of slices, and 0.5 V m(-1) p-p (177 mV m(-1) r.m.s.) in 20{\%}. These threshold fields are consistent with current environmental guidelines. They correspond to changes in somatic potential of approximately 70 microV, below membrane potential noise levels for neurons, demonstrating the emergent properties of neuronal networks can be more sensitive than measurable effects in single neurons.},

abstract = {Sensory stimuli reach the brain via the thalamocortical projection, a group of axons thought to be among the most powerful in the neocortex. Surprisingly, these axons account for only approximately 15{\%} of synapses onto cortical neurons. The thalamocortical pathway might thus achieve its effectiveness via high-efficacy thalamocortical synapses or via amplification within cortical layer 4. In rat somatosensory cortex, we measured in vivo the excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked by a single synaptic connection and found that thalamocortical synapses have low efficacy. Convergent inputs, however, are both numerous and synchronous, and intracortical amplification is not required. Our results suggest a mechanism of cortical activation by which thalamic input alone can drive cortex.},

abstract = {Noise can have a significant impact on the response dynamics of a nonlinear system. For neurons, the primary source of noise comes from background synaptic input activity. If this is approximated as white noise, the amplitude of the modulation of the firing rate in response to an input current oscillating at frequency omega decreases as 1/square root[omega] and lags the input by 45 degrees in phase. However, if filtering due to realistic synaptic dynamics is included, the firing rate is modulated by a finite amount even in the limit omega--{\textgreater}infinity and the phase lag is eliminated. Thus, through its effect on noise inputs, realistic synaptic dynamics can ensure unlagged neuronal responses to high-frequency inputs.},

abstract = {1. Transmembrane potential (TMP) responses of Purkinje cells (PCs) in isolated turtle cerebellum to externally applied quasi-steady-state electric fields aligned with the dendritic axis were continuously measured using simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recording. TMP was obtained by subtraction of extracellular voltage fields from intracellular potential recorded at the same depth in the cerebellum. 2. The applied field changed the TMP with the polarity and amplitude dependent on the location on the PC membrane. This response at a given location increased linearly with external field up to a threshold level, beyond which active responses appeared. 3. The basic effect on TMP consisted of depolarization in the half of the dendrite towards which the fields were directed, and hyperpolarization in the other half. A pooled TMP depth-profile shows a steady increase in polarization from the middle of the molecular layer towards each end. This profile correlates with that predicted from previously proposed cable models, giving them empirical support for the first time. 4. Active responses were triggered by the field-induced depolarization. Tetrodo- toxin (TTX)-sensitive action potentials arose with the primary depolarization in the somatic region. Notched, Ca2+-dependent action potentials arose with primary depolarization in the distal and mid-dendritic regions. 5. A TTX-sensitive voltage plateau was triggered by TMP-depolarization in the proximal region. It in turn activated Na+-spike trains. The frequency of spiking was proportional to the external field. At around 160 spikes/s, the Na+ spikes inactivated, and the TMP level rose to a more depolarized plateau. This latter plateau was also TTX-sensitive. 6. During depolarization of the distal dendritic region, sometimes a Ca21{\_} dependent plateau was observed. It appears to be associated with a small conductance increase. 7. Field-induced hyperp},

abstract = {An analysis of mode-locked solutions that may arise in periodically forced integrate-and-fire (IF) neural oscillators is introduced based upon a firing map formulation of the dynamics. A q:p mode-locked solution is identified with a spike train in which p firing events occur in a period qDelta, where Delta is the forcing period. A linear stability analysis of the map of firing times around such solutions allows the determination of the Arnold tongue structure for regions in parameter space where stable solutions exist. The analysis is verified against direct numerical simulations for both a sinusoidally forced IF system and one in which a periodic sequence of spikes is used to induce a biologically realistic synaptic input current. This approach is extended to the case of two synaptically coupled IF oscillators, showing that mode-locked states can exist for some self-consistently determined common period of repetitive firing. Numerical simulations show that such solutions have a bursting structure where regions of spiking activity are interspersed with quiescent periods before repeating. The influence of the synaptic current upon the Arnold tongue structure is explored in the regime of weak coupling.},

Using symbolic dynamic techniques we show how the dynamics of membrane potential has a one to one correspondence with sequences of spikes patterns (``raster plots''). Moreover, though the dynamics is generically periodic, it has a weak form of initial conditions sensitivity due to the presence of a sharp threshold in the model definition. As a consequence, the model exhibits a dynamical regime indistinguishable from chaos in numerical experiments.},

abstract = {During sensory stimulation, visual cortical neurons undergo massive synaptic bombardment. This increases their input conductance, and action potentials mainly result from membrane potential fluctuations. To understand the response properties of neurons operating in this regime, we studied a model neuron with synaptic inputs represented by transient membrane conductance changes. We show that with a simultaneous increase of excitation and inhibition, the firing rate first increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at higher input rates. Comodulation of excitation and inhibition, therefore, does not provide a straightforward way of controlling the neuronal firing rate, in contrast to coding mechanisms postulated previously. The synaptically induced conductance increase plays a key role in this effect: it decreases firing rate by shunting membrane potential fluctuations, and increases it by reducing the membrane time constant, allowing for faster membrane potential transients. These findings do not depend on details of the model and, hence, are relevant to cells of other cortical areas as well.},

@article{Amit1997,
abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical activity exhibits two distinct states: (a) synchronized rhythmic activity in the form of delta, spindle, and other slow waves during EEG-synchronized sleep and (b) tonic activity during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.},

abstract = {Characterizing the responsiveness of thalamic neurons is crucial to understanding the flow of sensory information. Typically, thalamocortical neurons possess two distinct firing modes. At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully relay synaptic inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing.},

@article{Rauch2003,
abstract = {In the intact brain neurons are constantly exposed to intense synaptic activity. This heavy barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was recreated in vitro by injecting a noisy current, generated as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, into the soma of rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The response to such in vivo-like currents was studied systematically by analyzing the time development of the instantaneous spike frequency, and when possible, the stationary mean spike frequency as a function of both the mean and the variance of the input current. All cells responded with an in vivo-like action potential activity with stationary statistics that could be sustained throughout long stimulation intervals (tens of seconds), provided the frequencies were not too high. The temporal evolution of the response revealed the presence of mechanisms of fast and slow spike frequency adaptation, and a medium duration mechanism of facilitation. For strong input currents, the slow adaptation mechanism made the spike frequency response nonstationary. The minimal frequencies that caused strong slow adaptation (a decrease in the spike rate by more than 1 Hz/s), were in the range 30-80 Hz and depended on the pipette solution used. The stationary response function has been fitted by two simple models of integrate-and-fire neurons endowed with a frequency-dependent modification of the input current. This accounts for all the fast and slow mechanisms of adaptation and facilitation that determine the stationary response, and proved necessary to fit the model to the experimental data. The coefficient of variability of the interspike interval was also in part captured by the model neurons, by tuning the parameters of the model to match the mean spike frequencies only. We conclude that the integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency-dependent adaptation/facilitation is an adequate model reduction of cortical cells when the mean spike-frequency response to in vivo-like currents with stationary statistics is considered.},

abstract = {The hippocampus plays a key role in the acquisition of new memories for places and events. Evidence suggests that the consolidation of these memories is enhanced during sleep. At the neuronal level, reactivation of awake experience in the hippocampus during sharp-wave ripple events, characteristic of slow-wave sleep, has been proposed as a neural mechanism for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. However, a causal relation between sleep reactivation and memory consolidation has not been established. Here we show that disrupting neuronal activity during ripple events impairs spatial learning. We trained rats daily in two identical spatial navigation tasks followed each by a 1-hour rest period. After one of the tasks, stimulation of hippocampal afferents selectively disrupted neuronal activity associated with ripple events without changing the sleep-wake structure. Rats learned the control task significantly faster than the task followed by rest stimulation, indicating that interfering with hippocampal processing during sleep led to decreased learning.},

@article{Schomburg2012,
abstract = {When monitoring neural activity using intracranial electrical recordings, researchers typically consider the signals to have two primary components: fast action potentials (APs) from neurons near the electrode, and the slower local field potential (LFP), thought to be dominated by postsynaptic currents integrated over a larger volume of tissue. In general, a decrease in signal power with increasing frequency is observed for most brain rhythms. The 100-200 Hz oscillations in the rat hippocampus, including "fast gamma" or "epsilon" oscillations and sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs), are one exception, showing an increase in power with frequency within this band. We have used detailed biophysical modeling to investigate the composition of extracellular potentials during fast oscillations in rat CA1. We find that postsynaptic currents exhibit a decreasing ability to generate large-amplitude oscillatory signals at high frequencies, whereas phase-modulated spiking shows the opposite trend. Our estimates indicate that APs and postsynaptic currents contribute similar proportions of the power contained in 140-200 Hz ripples, and the two combined generate a signal that closely resembles in vivo SPW-Rs. Much of the AP-generated signal originates from neurons further than 100 $\mu$m from the recording site, consistent with ripples appearing similarly strong regardless of whether or not they contain recognizable APs. Additionally, substantial power can be generated in the 90-150 Hz epsilon band by the APs of rhythmically firing pyramidal neurons. Thus, high-frequency LFPs may generally contain signatures of local cell assembly activation.},

abstract = {The tactile somatosensory pathway from whisker to cortex in rodents provides a well-defined system for exploring the link between molecular mechanisms, synaptic circuits, and behavior. The primary somatosensory cortex has an exquisite somatotopic map where each individual whisker is represented in a discrete anatomical unit, the "barrel," allowing precise delineation of functional organization, development, and plasticity. Sensory information is actively acquired in awake behaving rodents and processed differently within the barrel map depending upon whisker-related behavior. The prominence of state-dependent cortical sensory processing is likely to be crucial in our understanding of active sensory perception, experience-dependent plasticity and learning.},

abstract = {During fast oscillations in the local field potential (40-100 Hz gamma, 100-200 Hz sharp-wave ripples) single cortical neurons typically fire irregularly at rates that are much lower than the oscillation frequency. Recent computational studies have provided a mathematical description of such fast oscillations, using the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to populations of more realistic Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductance-based neurons. In a noisy network of GABAergic neurons that are connected randomly and sparsely by chemical synapses, coherent oscillations emerge with a frequency that depends sensitively on the single cell's membrane dynamics. The population frequency can be predicted analytically from the synaptic time constants and the preferred phase of discharge during the oscillatory cycle of a single cell subjected to noisy sinusoidal input. The latter depends significantly on the single cell's membrane properties and can be understood in the context of the simplified exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) neuron. We find that 200-Hz oscillations can be generated, provided the effective input conductance of single cells is large, so that the single neuron's phase shift is sufficiently small. In a two-population network of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons, recurrent excitation can either decrease or increase the population rhythmic frequency, depending on whether in a neuron the excitatory synaptic current follows or precedes the inhibitory synaptic current in an oscillatory cycle. Detailed single-cell properties have a substantial impact on population oscillations, even though rhythmicity does not originate from pacemaker neurons and is an emergent network phenomenon.},

abstract = {This review summarizes the local circuit, interlaminar connections in adult mammalian neocortex. These were first demonstrated with anatomical techniques, which indicate some of the exquisite spatial precision present in the circuitry. Details, such as the class(es) of neurons targeted by some of these projections, have begun to be added in studies that combine paired/triple intracellular recordings with dye-filling of connected neurons. Clear patterns are emerging from these studies, with 'forward' projections from layer 4 to 3 and from 3 to 5 targeting both selected pyramidal cells and interneurons, while 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and from 3 to 4 target only interneurons. To place these data in a wider context, the major afferent inputs to and efferent outputs from each of the layers are discussed first.},

abstract = {The cooperative action of neurons and glia generates electrical fields, but their effect on individual neurons via ephaptic interactions is mostly unknown. Here, we analyze the impact of spatially inhomogeneous electric fields on the membrane potential, the induced membrane field, and the induced current source density of one-dimensional cables as well as morphologically realistic neurons and discuss how the features of the extracellular field affect these quantities. We show through simulations that endogenous fields, associated with hippocampal theta and sharp waves, can greatly affect spike timing. These findings imply that local electric fields, generated by the cooperative action of brain cells, can influence the timing of neural activity.},

@article{Badel2008,
abstract = {The dynamic I-V curve method was recently introduced for the efficient experimental generation of reduced neuron models. The method extracts the response properties of a neuron while it is subject to a naturalistic stimulus that mimics in vivo-like fluctuating synaptic drive. The resulting history-dependent, transmembrane current is then projected onto a one-dimensional current-voltage relation that provides the basis for a tractable non-linear integrate-and-fire model. An attractive feature of the method is that it can be used in spike-triggered mode to quantify the distinct patterns of post-spike refractoriness seen in different classes of cortical neuron. The method is first illustrated using a conductance-based model and is then applied experimentally to generate reduced models of cortical layer-5 pyramidal cells and interneurons, in injected-current and injected- conductance protocols. The resulting low-dimensional neuron models-of the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire type-provide highly accurate predictions for spike-times. The method therefore provides a useful tool for the construction of tractable models and rapid experimental classification of cortical neurons.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of recurrent networks of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons in the presence of time-dependent inputs. The dynamics is characterized by the network dynamical transfer function, i.e., how the population firing rate is modulated by sinusoidal inputs at arbitrary frequencies. Two types of networks are studied and compared: (i) a Wilson-Cowan type firing rate model; and (ii) a fully connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, in a strong noise regime. We first characterize the region of stability of the "asynchronous state" (a state in which population activity is constant in time when external inputs are constant) in the space of parameters characterizing the connectivity of the network. We then systematically characterize the qualitative behaviors of the dynamical transfer function, as a function of the connectivity. We find that the transfer function can be either low-pass, or with a single or double resonance, depending on the connection strengths and synaptic time constants. Resonances appear when the system is close to Hopf bifurcations, that can be induced by two separate mechanisms: the I-I connectivity and the E-I connectivity. Double resonances can appear when excitatory delays are larger than inhibitory delays, due to the fact that two distinct instabilities exist with a finite gap between the corresponding frequencies. In networks of LIF neurons, changes in external inputs and external noise are shown to be able to change qualitatively the network transfer function. Firing rate models are shown to exhibit the same diversity of transfer functions as the LIF network, provided delays are present. They can also exhibit input-dependent changes of the transfer function, provided a suitable static non-linearity is incorporated.},

abstract = {Variations of excitatory and inhibitory conductances determine the membrane potential (V(m)) activity of neurons, as well as their spike responses, and are thus of primary importance. Methods to estimate these conductances require clamping the cell at several different levels of V(m), thus making it impossible to estimate conductances from "single trial" V(m) recordings. We present here a new method that allows extracting estimates of the full time course of excitatory and inhibitory conductances from single-trial V(m) recordings. This method is based on oversampling of the V(m). We test the method numerically using models of increasing complexity. Finally, the method is evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro using the dynamic-clamp technique. This conductance extraction method should be very useful for future in vivo applications.},

abstract = {Low intensity electric fields have been suggested to affect the ongoing neuronal activity in vitro and in human studies. However, the physiological mechanism of how weak electrical fields affect and interact with intact brain activity is not well understood. We performed in vivo extracellular and intracellular recordings from the neocortex and hippocampus of anesthetized rats and extracellular recordings in behaving rats. Electric fields were generated by sinusoid patterns at slow frequency (0.8, 1.25 or 1.7 Hz) via electrodes placed on the surface of the skull or the dura. Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) reliably entrained neurons in widespread cortical areas, including the hippocampus. The percentage of TES phase-locked neurons increased with stimulus intensity and depended on the behavioral state of the animal. TES-induced voltage gradient, as low as 1 mV/mm at the recording sites, was sufficient to phase-bias neuronal spiking. Intracellular recordings showed that both spiking and subthreshold activity were under the combined influence of TES forced fields and network activity. We suggest that TES in chronic preparations may be used for experimental and therapeutic control of brain activity.},

We found that, during periods of recurrent network activity (UP states), cortical pyramidal cells in vivo and in vitro receive strong barrages of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, with the inhibitory potentials showing much higher power at all frequencies above approximately 10 Hz and more synchrony between nearby neurons. Fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons discharged strongly in relation to higher-frequency oscillations in the field potential in vivo and possess membrane, synaptic, and action potential properties that are advantageous for transmission of higher-frequency activity. Intracellular injection of synaptic conductances having the characteristics of the recorded EPSPs and IPSPs reveal that IPSPs are important in controlling the timing and probability of action potential generation in pyramidal cells. Our results support the hypothesis that inhibitory networks are largely responsible for the dissemination of higher-frequency activity in cortex.},

abstract = {To extend the usefulness of rod bipolar cells for studies of chemical synaptic transmission, we have performed electrophysiological recordings from rod bipolar axon terminals in an in vitro slice preparation of the rat retina. Whole cell recordings from axon terminals and cell bodies were used to investigate the passive membrane properties of rod bipolar cells and analyzed with a two-compartment equivalent electrical circuit model developed by Mennerick et al. For both terminal- and soma-end recordings, capacitive current decays were well fitted by biexponential functions. Computer simulations of simplified models of rod bipolar cells demonstrated that estimates of the capacitance of the axon terminal compartment can depend critically on the recording location, with terminal-end recordings giving the best estimates. Computer simulations and whole cell recordings demonstrated that terminal-end recordings can yield more accurate estimates of the peak amplitude and kinetic properties of postsynaptic currents generated at the axon terminals due to increased electrotonic filtering of these currents when recorded at the soma. Finally, we present whole cell and outside-out patch recordings from axon terminals with responses evoked by GABA and glycine, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, voltage-gated Ca(2+) currents, and depolarization-evoked reciprocal synaptic responses, verifying that the recorded axon terminals are involved in normal pre- and postsynaptic relationships. These results demonstrate that axon terminals of rod bipolar cells are directly accessible to whole cell and outside-out patch recordings, extending the usefulness of this preparation for detailed studies of pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission in the CNS.},

abstract = {Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) has been suggested to act as a negative feedback mechanism responsible for globally and uniformly scaling (up or down) the strength of all synapses in the neuron, in compensation for chronically aberrant (too low or too high) levels of activity. Such global scaling preserves the relative strengths of synapses and thus keeps 'Hebbian-like' memory traces (long-term potentiations, LTP, or depressions, LTD). However, new experimental findings demonstrate that HSP can operate locally, controlling each synapse individually. Seemingly, this finding implies that HSP can abolish any modification of synaptic strength (erase LTP/LTD). We propose that dendrites offer an inherent solution to this 'paradox' and that in fact local HSP might confer upon the neuron several surprising benefits, which are demonstrated using computer simulations.},

abstract = {In awake animals, the cerebral cortex displays an "activated" state, with distinct characteristics compared to other states like slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. These characteristics include a sustained depolarized membrane potential (V(m)) and irregular firing activity. In the present paper, we evaluate our understanding of cortical activated states from a computational neuroscience point of view. We start by reviewing the electrophysiological characteristics of activated cortical states based on recordings and analysis performed in awake cat association cortex. These analyses show that cortical activity is characterized by an apparent Poisson-distributed stochastic dynamics, both at the single-cell and population levels, and that single cells display a high-conductance state dominated by inhibition. We next overview computational models of the "awake" cortex, and perform the same analyses as in the experiments. Many properties identified experimentally are indeed reproduced by models, such as depolarized V(m), irregular firing with apparent Poisson statistics, and the determinant role of inhibitory fluctuations on spiking. However, other features are not well reproduced, such as firing statistics and the conductance state of the membrane, suggesting that the network state displayed by models is not entirely correct. We also show how networks can approach a correct conductance state, suggesting ways by which future models will generate activity fully consistent with experimental data.},

abstract = {Functional interactions between neurons in vivo are often quantified by cross-correlation functions (CCFs) between their spike trains. It is therefore essential to understand quantitatively how CCFs are shaped by different factors, such as connectivity, synaptic parameters, and background activity. Here, we study the CCF between two neurons using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We quantify the role of synaptic parameters, such as peak conductance, decay time, and reversal potential, and analyze how various patterns of connectivity influence CCF shapes. In particular, we find that the symmetry of the CCF distinguishes in general, but not always, the case of shared inputs between two neurons from the case in which they are directly synaptically connected. We systematically examine the influence of background synaptic inputs from the surrounding network that set the baseline firing statistics of the neurons and modulate their response properties. We find that variations in the background noise modify the amplitude of the cross-correlation function as strongly as variations of synaptic strength. In particular, we show that the postsynaptic neuron spiking regularity has a pronounced influence on CCF amplitude. This suggests an efficient and flexible mechanism for modulating functional interactions.},

Traditional firing-rate models assume a simple form in which the dynamics are governed by a single time constant. These models fail to replicate certain dynamic features of populations of spiking neurons, especially those involving synchronization. We present a complex-valued firing-rate model derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to the linear, quadratic and exponential integrate-and-fire models. Despite being almost as simple as a traditional firing-rate description, this model can reproduce firing-rate dynamics due to partial synchronization of the action potentials in a spiking model, and it successfully predicts the transition to spike synchronization in networks of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons.},

We investigated the mechanisms underpinning cerebellar oscillations. We found that Golgi interneurons, which gate information transfer in the cerebellar cortex input layer, are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. When depolarized in vitro, these neurons displayed low-frequency oscillatory synchronization, imposing rhythmic inhibition onto granule cells. Combining experiments and modeling, we show that electrical transmission of the spike afterhyperpolarization is the essential component for oscillatory population synchronization. Rhythmic firing arises in spite of strong heterogeneities, is frequency tuned by the mean excitatory input to Golgi cells, and displays pronounced resonance when the modeled network is driven by oscillating inputs. In vivo, unitary Golgi cell activity was found to synchronize with low-frequency LFP oscillations occurring during quiet waking. These results suggest a major role for Golgi cells in coordinating cerebellar sensorimotor integration during oscillatory interactions.},

abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites; thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABA(A) receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and--in various combinations--electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations ({\textgreater}100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.},

Using this formalism, we analyze different regimes of synaptic transmission and demonstrate that dynamic synapses transmit different aspects of the presynaptic activity depending on the average presynaptic frequency.

Therefore, only axons lying in a shell around the electrode are stimulated. Elements very close to the electrode may not be stimulated. Close to an electrode small diameter axons may be stimulated and larger ones may not be. (3) Most, and perhaps all, CNS myelinated fibers have chronaxies of 50-100 {\#}sec.

(5) It takes less cathodal current than anodal to stimulate a myelinated fiber passing by a monopolar electrode. When a monopolar electrode is near a cell body, on the opposite side from the axon, often the lowest threshold is anodal, but some- times cathodal.

abstract = {The thalamic output during different behavioral states is strictly controlled by the firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. During sleep, their hyperpolarized membrane potential allows activation of the T-type calcium channels, promoting rhythmic high-frequency burst firing that reduces sensory information transfer. In contrast, in the waking state thalamic neurons mostly exhibit action potentials at low frequency (i.e., tonic firing), enabling the reliable transfer of incoming sensory inputs to cortex. Because of their nearly complete inactivation at the depolarized potentials that are experienced during the wake state, T-channels are not believed to modulate tonic action potential discharges. Here, we demonstrate using mice brain slices that activation of T-channels in thalamocortical neurons maintained in the depolarized/wake-like state is critical for the reliable expression of tonic firing, securing their excitability over changes in membrane potential that occur in the depolarized state. Our results establish a novel mechanism for the integration of sensory information by thalamocortical neurons and point to an unexpected role for T-channels in the early stage of information processing.},

@article{Tranchina1986,
abstract = {A model is presented for the subthreshold polarization of a neuron by an applied electric field. It gives insight into how morphological features of a neuron affect its polarizability. The neuronal model consists of one or more extensively branched dendritic trees, a lumped somatic impedance, and a myelinated axon with nodes of Ranvier. The dendritic trees branch according to the 3/2-power rule of Rall, so that each tree has an equivalent cylinder representation. Equations for the membrane potential at the soma and at the nodes of Ranvier, given an arbitrary specified external potential, are derived. The solutions determine the contributions made by the dendritic tree and the axon to the net polarization at the soma. In the case of a spatially constant electric field, both the magnitude and sign of the polarization depend on simple combinations of parameters describing the neuron. One important combination is given by the ratio of internal resistances for longitudinal current spread along the dendritic tree trunk and along the axon. A second is given by the ratio between the DC space constant for the dendritic tree trunk and the distance between nodes of Ranvier in the axon. A third is given by the product of the electric field and the space constant for the trunk of the dendritic tree. When a neuron with a straight axon is subjected to a constant field, the membrane potential decays exponentially with distance from the soma. Thus, the soma seems to be a likely site for action potential initiation when the field is strong enough to elicit suprathreshold polarization. In a simple example, the way in which orientation of the various parts of the neuron affects its polarization is examined. When an axon with a bend is subjected to a spatially constant field, polarization is focused at the bend, and this is another likely site for action potential initiation.},

In the first article, they derived an expression for the stationary probability density of the membrane voltage; in the second, they modified this expression to cover a larger parameter regime. Here we show by standard analysis of solvable limit cases (white noise limit of additive and multiplicative noise sources; only slow multiplicative noise; only additive noise) and by numerical simulations that their first result does not hold for the general colored-noise case and uncover the errors made in the derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically (including an exact integral expression for the time-dependent mean value of the voltage) and by comparison to simulation results that the extended expression for the probability density works much better but still does not exactly solve the full colored-noise problem. We also show that at stronger synaptic input, the stationary mean value of the linear voltage model may diverge and give an exact condition relating the system parameters for which this takes place.},

abstract = {Receptive fields (RFs) of cells in the middle temporal area (MT or V5) of monkeys will often encompass multiple objects under normal image viewing. We therefore have studied how multiple moving stimuli interact when presented within and near the RF of single MT cells. We used moving Gabor function stimuli, {\textless}1 degrees in spatial extent and approximately 100 msec in duration, presented on a grid of possible locations over the RF of the cell. Responses to these stimuli were typically robust, and their small spatial and temporal extent allowed detailed mapping of RFs and of interactions between stimuli. The responses to pairs of such stimuli were compared against the responses to the same stimuli presented singly. The responses were substantially less than the sum of the responses to the component stimuli and were well described by a power-law summation model with divisive inhibition. Such divisive inhibition is a key component of recently proposed "normalization" models of cortical physiology and is presumed to arise from lateral interconnections within a region. One open question is whether the normalization occurs only once in primary visual cortex or multiple times in different cortical areas. We addressed this question by exploring the spatial extent over which one stimulus would divide the response to another and found effective normalization from stimuli quite far removed from the RF center. This supports models under which normalization occurs both in MT and in earlier stages.},

abstract = {The activity of the cerebral cortex is thought to depend on the precise relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition. In the visual cortex, in particular, intracellular measurements have related response selectivity to coordinated increases in excitation and inhibition. These measurements, however, have all been made during anaesthesia, which strongly influences cortical state and therefore sensory processing. The synaptic activity that is evoked by visual stimulation during wakefulness is unknown. Here we measured visually evoked responses--and the underlying synaptic conductances--in the visual cortex of anaesthetized and awake mice. Under anaesthesia, responses could be elicited from a large region of visual space and were prolonged. During wakefulness, responses were more spatially selective and much briefer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic conductances showed a difference in synaptic inhibition between the two conditions. Under anaesthesia, inhibition tracked excitation in amplitude and spatial selectivity. By contrast, during wakefulness, inhibition was much stronger than excitation and had extremely broad spatial selectivity. We conclude that during wakefulness, cortical responses to visual stimulation are dominated by synaptic inhibition, restricting the spatial spread and temporal persistence of neural activity. These results provide a direct glimpse of synaptic mechanisms that control sensory responses in the awake cortex.},

abstract = {Many theories of cerebellar function assume that long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber (PF) synapses enables Purkinje cells to learn to recognize PF activity patterns. We have studied the LTD-based recognition of PF patterns in a biophysically realistic Purkinje-cell model. With simple-spike firing as observed in vivo, the presentation of a pattern resulted in a burst of spikes followed by a pause. Surprisingly, the best criterion to distinguish learned patterns was the duration of this pause. Moreover, our simulations predicted that learned patterns elicited shorter pauses, thus increasing Purkinje-cell output. We tested this prediction in Purkinje-cell recordings both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we found a shortening of pauses when decreasing the number of active PFs or after inducing LTD. In vivo, we observed longer pauses in LTD-deficient mice. Our results suggest a novel form of neural coding in the cerebellar cortex. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This method detects the effect of a single synaptic input on the postsynaptic spike output in the presence of massive background synaptic activity in neuron models of progressively increasing realism. SIE increased with increases either in time locking between the input synapse activity and the output spike or in the average number of output spikes. SIE depended on the context in which the synapse operates. We also measured SIE experimentally.

Based on our dynamics results, we propose that a V1 cell's orientation selectivity is generated mainly by both tuned enhancement and global suppression. Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell's preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex.},

Receptive field subregions were often precisely shared among neighboring neurons. Furthermore, large subregions seem to be assembled from multiple smaller, non-overlapping subregions of other neurons in the same local population. These experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first characterization of the diversity of receptive fields in a dense local network of visual cortex and reveal elementary units of receptive field organization. Our results suggest that a limited pool of afferent receptive fields is available to a local population of neurons and reveal new organizational principles for the neural circuitry of the mouse visual cortex.},

abstract = {Orientation tuning of neurons is one of the chief emergent characteristics of the primary visual cortex, V1. Neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus, which comprise the thalamic input to V1, are not orientation-tuned, but the majority of V1 neurons are quite selective. How orientation tuning arises within V1 is still controversial. To study this problem, we measured how the orientation tuning of neurons evolves with time using a new method: reverse correlation in the orientation domain. Orientation tuning develops after a delay of 30-45 milliseconds and persists for 40-85 ms. Neurons in layers 4C alpha or 4C beta, which receive direct input from the thalamus, show a single orientation preference which remains unchanged throughout the response period. In contrast, the preferred orientations of output layer neurons (in layers 2, 3, 4B, 5 or 6) usually change with time, and in many cases the orientation tuning may have more than one peak. This difference in dynamics is accompanied by a change in the sharpness of orientation tuning; cells in the input layers are more broadly tuned than cells in the output layers. Many of these observed properties of output layer neurons cannot be explained by simple feedforward models, whereas they arise naturally in feedback networks. Our results indicate that V1 is more than a bank of static oriented filters; the dynamics of output layer cells appear to be shaped by intracortical feedback.},

The notion of a hierarchy of receptive fields, where increasingly intricate receptive fields are constructed from more elementary ones, was introduced. Since those early days we have witnessed the birth of quantitative methods to map receptive fields and mathematical descriptions of simple and complex cell function. Insights gained from these models, along with new theoretical concepts, are refining our understanding of receptive field structure and the underlying cortical circuitry.

abstract = {It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses, but it has been difficult to determine what this variability means. Is it noise, or does it carry important information-about, for example, the internal state of the organism? Here we address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces approximately 28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets. We also show, using simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings, that a single spike in a neuron produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulus-independent variations in membrane potential of the order of +/-2.2-4.5 mV-variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains. However, in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code.},

This persistent activity can be sustained by ongoing reverberant network activity or by the intrinsic biophysical properties of individual cells. Here we demonstrate that rat and guinea pig cerebellar Purkinje cells in vivo show bistability of membrane potential and spike output on the time scale of seconds. The transition between membrane potential states can be bidirectionally triggered by the same brief current pulses. We also show that sensory activation of the climbing fiber input can switch Purkinje cells between the two states. The intrinsic nature of Purkinje cell bistability and its control by sensory input can be explained by a simple biophysical model.

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex span multiple cortical layers. How the excitable properties of pyramidal neuron dendrites allow these neurons to both integrate activity and store associations between different layers is not well understood, but is thought to rely in part on dendritic backpropagation of action potentials. Here we demonstrate that the sign of synaptic plasticity in neocortical pyramidal neurons is regulated by the spread of the backpropagating action potential to the synapse. This creates a progressive gradient between LTP and LTD as the distance of the synaptic contacts from the soma increases. At distal synapses, cooperative synaptic input or dendritic depolarization can switch plasticity between LTD and LTP by boosting backpropagation of action potentials. This activity-dependent switch provides a mechanism for associative learning across different neocortical layers that process distinct types of information. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The same electrode is then placed on the neuron under visual control to allow formation of a gigaseal ('shadowpatching'). We demonstrate the reliability and versatility of shadowpatching by performing whole-cell recordings from visually identified neurons in the neocortex and cerebellum of rat and mouse. We also show that the method can be used for targeted in vivo single-cell electroporation of plasmid DNA into identified cell types, leading to stable transgene expression. This approach facilitates the recording, labeling and genetic manipulation of single neurons in the intact native mammalian brain without the need to pre-label neuronal populations.},

abstract = {Understanding the principles governing axonal and dendritic branching is essential for unravelling the functionality of single neurons and the way in which they connect. Nevertheless, no formalism has yet been described which can capture the general features of neuronal branching. Here we propose such a formalism, which is derived from the expression of dendritic arborizations as locally optimized graphs. Inspired by Ram{\'{o}}n y Cajal's laws of conservation of cytoplasm and conduction time in neural circuitry, we show that this graphical representation can be used to optimize these variables. This approach allows us to generate synthetic branching geometries which replicate morphological features of any tested neuron. The essential structure of a neuronal tree is thereby captured by the density profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction time. This balancing factor determines a neuron's electrotonic compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in the construction process, can be directly attributed to developmental processes or a neuron's computational role within its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are implemented in an open-source software package, the "TREES toolbox," which provides a general set of tools for analyzing, manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a tool to create synthetic members of any particular cell group and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks. These approaches provide new insights into the constraints governing dendritic architectures. They also provide a novel framework for modelling and analyzing neuronal branching structures and for constructing realistic synthetic neural networks.},

Here we show that pairing CF activation with bursts of PF activity triggers large ({\textgreater}10 µM) calcium signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. When PFs are densely activated, signals span whole dendritic branchlets and are mediated by voltage-dependent calcium entry. When PFs are sparsely activated, however, signals are restricted to single spines and blocked by metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Single-spine signals and sparse-stimulation LTD are also blocked by thapsigargin, indicating that calcium must be released from stores. Single-spine sig- nals and sparse-stimulation LTD are greatest when PF activation precedes the CF activation within 50–200 ms. This timing rule matches the properties of several forms of motor learning, providing a link between behavior and functional properties of cerebellar synaptic plasticity},

abstract = {The origin of orientation selectivity in visual cortical responses is a central problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. In cats, many experiments suggest that orientation selectivity arises from the arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents to layer 4 simple cells. However, this explanation is not sufficient to account for the contrast invariance of orientation tuning. To understand contrast invariance, we first characterize the input to cat simple cells generated by the oriented arrangement of LGN afferents. We demonstrate that it has two components: a spatial-phase-specific component (i.e., one that depends on receptive field spatial phase), which is tuned for orientation, and a phase-nonspecific component, which is untuned. Both components grow with contrast. Second, we show that a correlation-based intracortical circuit, in which connectivity between cell pairs is determined by the correlation of their LGN inputs, is sufficient to achieve well tuned, contrast-invariant orientation tuning. This circuit generates both spatially opponent, "antiphase" inhibition ("push-pull"), and spatially matched, "same-phase" excitation. The inhibition, if sufficiently strong, suppresses the untuned input component and sharpens responses to the tuned component at all contrasts. The excitation amplifies tuned responses. This circuit agrees with experimental evidence showing spatial opponency between, and similar orientation tuning of, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs received by a simple cell. Orientation tuning is primarily input driven, accounting for the observed invariance of tuning width after removal of intracortical synaptic input, as well as for the dependence of orientation tuning on stimulus spatial frequency. The model differs from previous push-pull models in requiring dominant rather than balanced inhibition and in predicting that a population of layer 4 inhibitory neurons should respond in a contrast-dependent manner to stimuli of all orientations, although their tuning width may be similar to that of excitatory neurons. The model demonstrates that fundamental response properties of cortical layer 4 can be explained by circuitry expected to develop under correlation-based rules of synaptic plasticity, and shows how such circuitry allows the cortex to distinguish stimulus intensity from stimulus form.},

In this review, we discuss how these dendritic properties influence the rules governing the induction of synaptic plasticity. We argue that the location of synapses in the dendritic tree, and the type of dendritic excitability associated with each synapse, play decisive roles in determining the plastic properties of that synapse. Furthermore, since the electrical properties of the dendritic tree are not static, but can be altered by neuromodulators and by synaptic activity itself, we discuss how learning rules may be dynamically shaped by tuning dendritic function. We conclude by describing how this reciprocal relationship between plasticity of dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity has changed our view of information processing and memory storage in neuronal networks.},

abstract = {The existence of two classes of cells, simple and complex, discovered by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962, is one of the fundamental features of cat primary visual cortex. A quantitative measure used to distinguish simple and complex cells is the ratio between modulated and unmodulated components of spike responses to drifting gratings, an index that forms a bimodal distribution. We have found that the modulation ratio, when derived from the subthreshold membrane potential instead of from spike rate, is unimodally distributed, but highly skewed. The distribution of the modulation ratio as derived from spike rate can, in turn, be predicted quantitatively by the nonlinear properties of spike threshold applied to the skewed distribution of the subthreshold modulation ratio. Threshold also increases the spatial segregation of ON and OFF regions of the receptive field, a defining attribute of simple cells. The distinction between simple and complex cells is therefore enhanced by threshold, much like the selectivity for stimulus features such as orientation and direction. In this case, however, a continuous distribution in the spatial organization of synaptic inputs is transformed into two distinct classes of cells.},

abstract = {Ever since Hubel and Wiesel described orientation selectivity in the visual cortex, the question of how precise selectivity emerges has been marked by considerable debate. There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Tuning for speed is one key feature of motion-selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area of the macaque cortex (MT, or V5). The present paper asks whether speed is coded in a way that is invariant to the shape of the moving stimulus, and if so, how. When tested with single sine-wave gratings of different spatial and temporal frequencies, MT neurons show a continuum in the degree to which preferred speed depends on spatial frequency. There is some dependence in 75{\%} of MT neurons, and the other 25{\%} maintain speed tuning despite changes in spatial frequency. When tested with stimuli constructed by adding two superimposed sine-wave gratings, the preferred speed of MT neurons becomes less dependent on spatial frequency. Analysis of these responses reveals a speed-tuning nonlinearity that selectively enhances the responses of the neuron when multiple spatial frequencies are present and moving at the same speed. Consistent with the presence of the nonlinearity, MT neurons show speed tuning that is close to form-invariant when the moving stimuli comprise square-wave gratings, which contain multiple spatial frequencies moving at the same speed. We conclude that the neural circuitry in and before MT makes no explicit attempt to render MT neurons speed-tuned for sine-wave gratings, which do not occur in natural scenes. Instead, MT neurons derive form-invariant speed tuning in a way that takes advantage of the multiple spatial frequencies that comprise moving objects in natural scenes.},

abstract = {Neurons in visual cortex are linked by an extensive network of lateral connections. To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a approximately 1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.},

abstract = {One of the central questions in neuroscience is how particular tasks, or computations, are implemented by neural networks to generate behavior. The prevailing view has been that information processing in neural networks results primarily from the properties of synapses and the connectivity of neurons within the network, with the intrinsic excitability of single neurons playing a lesser role. As a consequence, the contribution of single neurons to computation in the brain has long been underestimated. Here we review recent work showing that neuronal dendrites exhibit a range of linear and nonlinear mechanisms that allow them to implement elementary computations. We discuss why these dendritic properties may be essential for the computations performed by the neuron and the network and provide theoretical and experimental examples to support this view.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex receive subliminal information originating from the periphery of their receptive fields (RF) through a variety of cortical connections. In the cat primary visual cortex, long-range horizontal axons have been reported to preferentially bind to distant columns of similar orientation preferences, whereas feedback connections from higher visual areas provide a more diverse functional input. To understand the role of these lateral interactions, it is crucial to characterize their effective functional connectivity and tuning properties. However, the overall functional impact of cortical lateral connections, whatever their anatomical origin, is unknown since it has never been directly characterized. Using direct measurements of postsynaptic integration in cat areas 17 and 18, we performed multi-scale assessments of the functional impact of visually driven lateral networks. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging showed that local oriented stimuli evoke an orientation-selective activity that remains confined to the cortical feedforward imprint of the stimulus. Beyond a distance of one hypercolumn, the lateral spread of cortical activity gradually lost its orientation preference approximated as an exponential with a space constant of about 1 mm. Intracellular recordings showed that this loss of orientation selectivity arises from the diversity of converging synaptic input patterns originating from outside the classical RF. In contrast, when the stimulus size was increased, we observed orientation-selective spread of activation beyond the feedforward imprint. We conclude that stimulus-induced cooperativity enhances the long-range orientation-selective spread.},

abstract = {Simultaneous recording from large numbers of neurons is a prerequisite for understanding their cooperative behavior. Various recording techniques and spike separation methods are being used toward this goal. However, the error rates involved in spike separation have not yet been quantified. We studied the separation reliability of "tetrode" (4-wire electrode)-recorded spikes by monitoring simultaneously from the same cell intracellularly with a glass pipette and extracellularly with a tetrode. With manual spike sorting, we found a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors, with errors typically ranging from 0 to 30{\%} depending on the amplitude and firing pattern of the cell, the similarity of the waveshapes of neighboring neurons, and the experience of the operator. Performance using only a single wire was markedly lower, indicating the advantages of multiple-site monitoring techniques over single-wire recordings. For tetrode recordings, error rates were increased by burst activity and during periods of cellular synchrony. The lowest possible separation error rates were estimated by a search for the best ellipsoidal cluster shape. Human operator performance was significantly below the estimated optimum. Investigation of error distributions indicated that suboptimal performance was caused by inability of the operators to mark cluster boundaries accurately in a high-dimensional feature space. We therefore hypothesized that automatic spike-sorting algorithms have the potential to significantly lower error rates. Implementation of a semi-automatic classification system confirms this suggestion, reducing errors close to the estimated optimum, in the range 0-8{\%}.},

abstract = {Simple cells in primary visual cortex exhibit contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in seeming contradiction to feed-forward models that rely on lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input alone. Contrast invariance has therefore been thought to depend on the presence of intracortical lateral inhibition. In vivo intracellular recordings instead suggest that contrast invariance can be explained by three properties of the excitatory pathway. (1) Depolarizations evoked by orthogonal stimuli are determined by the amount of excitation a cell receives from the LGN, relative to the excitation it receives from other cortical cells. (2) Depolarizations evoked by preferred stimuli saturate at lower contrasts than the spike output of LGN relay cells. (3) Visual stimuli evoke contrast-dependent changes in trial-to-trial variability, which lead to contrast-dependent changes in the relationship between membrane potential and spike rate. Thus, high-contrast, orthogonally oriented stimuli that evoke significant depolarizations evoke few spikes. Together these mechanisms, without lateral inhibition, can account for contrast-invariant stimulus selectivity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

An example of temporal coding is the hippocampal phase precession phenomenon, in which the timing of pyramidal cell spikes relative to the theta rhythm shows a unidirectional forward precession during spatial behaviour. Here we show that phase precession occurs in both spatial and non-spatial behaviours. We found that spike phase correlated with instantaneous discharge rate, and processed unidirectionally at high rates, regardless of behaviour. The spatial phase precession phenomenon is therefore a manifestation of a more fundamental principle governing the timing of pyramidal cell discharge. We suggest that intrinsic properties of pyramidal cells have a key role in determining spike times, and that the interplay between the magnitude of dendritic excitation and rhythmic inhibition of the somatic region is responsible for the phase assignment of spikes.},

abstract = {The moving observer who looks in the direction of heading experiences radial optic flow, which is known to elicit horizontal vergence eye movements at short latency, expansion causing convergence and contraction causing divergence: the Radial Flow Vergence Response (RFVR). The moving observer who looks off to one side experiences linear flow, which is known to elicit horizontal version eye movements at short latency: the Ocular Following Response (OFR). Although the RFVR and OFR are very different kinds of eye movement and are sensitive to very different patterns of global motion, they have very similar local spatiotemporal properties. For example, both responses are critically dependent on the Fourier composition of the motion stimuli, consistent with early spatio-temporal filtering prior to motion detection, as in the well-known energy model of motion analysis. When the motion stimuli are sine-wave gratings, the two responses share a very similar dependence on the spatial frequency and contrast of those gratings, and even the quantitative details are very similar. When the motion consists of a single step (“two-frame movie”) then a brief inter-stimulus interval results in the reversal of both responses, consistent with the idea that both are mediated by motion detectors that receive a visual input whose temporal impulse response function is strongly biphasic. Further, when confronted with two sine-wave gratings that differ slightly in spatial frequency and have competing motions, both responses show nonlinear dependence on the relative contrasts of those two gratings: when the two sine waves differ in contrast by more than about an octave then the one with the higher contrast completely dominates the responses and the one with lower contrast loses its influence: winner-take-all. It has been suggested that these nonlinear interactions result from mutual inhibition between the low-level mechanisms sensing the motion of the different competing harmonics. Lastly, single unit recordings and local lesions in monkeys strongly suggest that both types of eye movements are mediated by neurons in the MT/MST region of the cerebral cortex that are sensitive to global optic flow. We will argue that these various findings are all consistent with the idea that the RFVR and OFR acquire their different global properties at the level of MT/MST, where the neurons respond to large-field radial and linear optic flow, and their shared local properties from a common earlier stage, the striate cortex, where the neurons respond to the local motion energy.},

We refer to this activated area as the cortical response field, the properties of which remain unexplored. Here, the dynamics of cortical response fields evoked in visual cortex by small, local drifting-oriented gratings were explored using voltage-sensitive dyes. We found that the cortical response field was often characterized by a plateau of activity, beyond the rim of which activity diminished quickly. Plateau rim location was largely independent of stimulus orientation. However, approximately 20 ms following plateau onset, 1-3 peaks emerged on it and were amplified for 25 ms. Spiking was limited to the peak zones, whose location strongly depended on stimulus orientation. Thus, alongside selective amplification of a spatially restricted suprathreshold response, wider activation to just below threshold encompasses all orientation domains within a well-defined retinotopic vicinity of the current stimulus, priming the cortex for processing of subsequent stimuli.},

abstract = {Information in neuronal networks is thought to be represented by the rate of discharge and the temporal relationship between the discharging neurons. The discharge frequency of neurons is affected by their afferents and intrinsic properties, and shows great individual variability. The temporal coordination of neurons is greatly facilitated by network oscillations. In the hippocampus, population synchrony fluctuates during theta and gamma oscillations (10-100 ms scale) and can increase almost 10-fold during sharp wave bursts. Despite these large changes in excitability in the sub-second scale, longer-term (minute-scale) firing rates of individual neurons are relatively constant in an unchanging environment. As a result, mean hippocampal output remains stable over time. To understand the mechanisms responsible for this homeostasis, we address the following issues: (i) Can firing rates of single cells be modified? (ii) Once modified, what mechanism(s) can maintain the changes? We show that firing rates of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be altered in a novel environment and by Hebbian pairing of physiological input patterns with postsynaptic burst discharge. We also illustrate a competition between single spikes and the occurrence of spike bursts. Since spike-inducing (suprathreshold) inputs decrease the ability of strong ('teaching') inputs to induce a burst discharge, we propose that the single spike versus burst competition presents a homeostatic regulatory mechanism to maintain synaptic strength and, consequently, firing rate in pyramidal cells.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit powerful suppressive phenomena such as contrast saturation, size tuning, and masking. These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field (which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.},

Because of the paucity of information on the network patterns of the mouse hippocampus, we investigated the electrical patterns in the behaving animal using multisite silicon probes and wire tetrodes. Theta (6-9 Hz) and gamma (40-100 Hz) oscillations were present during exploration and rapid eye movement sleep. Gamma power and theta power were comodulated and gamma power varied as a function of the theta cycle. Pyramidal cells and putative interneurons were phase-locked to theta oscillations. During immobility, consummatory behaviors and slow-wave sleep, sharp waves were present in cornu ammonis region CA1 of the hippocampus stratum radiatum associated with 140-200-Hz "ripples" in the pyramidal cell layer and population burst of CA1 neurons. In the hilus, large-amplitude "dentate spikes" occurred in association with increased discharge of hilar neurons. The amplitude of field patterns was larger in the mouse than in the rat, likely reflecting the higher neuron density in a smaller brain. We suggest that the main hippocampal network patterns are mediated by similar pathways and mechanisms in mouse and rat. {\textcopyright} 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

It therefore remains to be demonstrated how physical signals of grating motion across the cortex are represented independently of other parametric maps and thus, how multi-dimensional input is processed independently to enable effective read-out further downstream.Taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution of voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we here show the real-time encoding of position and orientation. By decomposing the cortical responses to drifting gratings we visualize the typical emergence of stationary orientation maps in which specific domains exhibited highest amplitudes. Simultaneously to these patchy maps, we demonstrate coherently propagating waves of activity that precisely matched the actual movement of the gratings in space and time, most dominantly for spatial frequencies lower than the preferred range. Thus, the primary visual cortex multiplexes information about retinotopic motion by additional temporal modulation of stationary orientation signals. These signals may be used to variably extract coarse-grained object motion and form information at higher visual processing stages. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we show that such fluctuations may contribute to representation of visual stimuli by cortical cells. In complex cells of anesthetized cats, where such fluctuations are most prominent, prolonged visual stimulation increased the probability of the up state. This probability increase was related to stimulus strength: its dependence on stimulus orientation and contrast matched each cell's averaged membrane potential. Thus large fluctuations in membrane potential are not simply noise on which visual responses are superimposed, but may provide a substrate for encoding sensory information.},

abstract = {Direction selectivity in simple cells of primary visual cortex, defined from their spike responses, cannot be predicted using linear models. It has been suggested that the shunting inhibition evoked by visual stimulation is responsible for the nonlinear component of direction selectivity. Cortical inhibition would suppress a neuron's firing when stimuli move in the nonpreferred direction, but would allow responses to stimuli in the preferred direction. Models of direction selectivity based solely on input from the lateral geniculate nucleus, however, propose that the nonlinear response is caused by spike threshold. By extracting excitatory and inhibitory components of synaptic inputs from intracellular records obtained in vivo, we demonstrate that excitation and inhibition are tuned for the same direction, but differ in relative timing. Further, membrane potential responses combine in a linear fashion. Spike threshold, however, quantitatively accounts for the nonlinear component of direction selectivity, amplifying the direction selectivity of spike output relative to that of synaptic inputs.},

abstract = {We study a recently proposed "correlation-based," push-pull model of the circuitry of layer 4 of cat visual cortex. This model was previously shown to explain the contrast-invariance of cortical orientation tuning. Here we show that it can simultaneously account for several contrast-dependent (c-d) "nonlinearities" in cortical responses. These include an advance with increasing contrast in the temporal phase of response to a sinusoidally modulated stimulus; a change in shape of the temporal frequency tuning curve, so that higher temporal frequencies may give little or no response at low contrast but reasonable responses at high contrast; and contrast saturation that occurs at lower contrasts in cortex than in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In the context of the model circuit, these properties arise from a mixture of nonlinear cellular and synaptic mechanisms: short-term synaptic depression, spike-rate adaptation, contrast-induced changes in cellular conductance, and the nonzero spike threshold. The former three mechanisms are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed increase in c-d phase advance in cortex relative to LGN. The c-d changes in temporal frequency tuning arise as a threshold effect: voltage modulations in response to higher-frequency inputs are only slightly above threshold at lower contrast, but become robustly suprathreshold at higher contrast. The other three nonlinear mechanisms also play a crucial role in this result, allowing contrast dependence of temporal frequency tuning to coexist with contrast-invariance of orientation tuning. Contrast saturation, and the observation that responses to stimuli of increasing temporal frequency saturate at increasingly high contrasts, can be induced both by the model's push-pull inhibition and by synaptic depression. Previous proposals explained these nonlinear response properties by assuming contrast-invariant orientation tuning as a starting point, and adding normalization by shunting inhibition derived equally from cells of all preferred orientations. The present proposal simultaneously explains both contrast-invariant orientation tuning and these contrast-dependent nonlinearities and requires only processing that is local in orientation, in agreement with intracellular measurements.},

abstract = {Action potential propagation links information processing in different regions of the dendritic tree. To examine the contribution of dendritic morphology to the efficacy of propagation, simulations were performed in detailed reconstructions of eight different neuronal types. With identical complements of voltage-gated channels, different dendritic morphologies exhibit distinct patterns of propagation. Remarkably, the range of backpropagation efficacies observed experimentally can be reproduced by the variations in dendritic morphology alone. Dendritic geometry also determines the extent to which modulation of channel densities can affect propagation. Thus in Purkinje cells and dopamine neurons, backpropagation is relatively insensitive to changes in channel densities, whereas in pyramidal cells, backpropagation can be modulated over a wide range. We also demonstrate that forward propagation of dendritically initiated action potentials is influenced by morphology in a similar manner. We show that these functional consequences of the differences in dendritic geometries can be explained quantitatively using simple anatomical measures of dendritic branching patterns, which are captured in a reduced model of dendritic geometry. These findings indicate that differences in dendritic geometry act in concert with differences in voltage-gated channel density and kinetics to generate the diversity in dendritic action potential propagation observed between neurons. They also suggest that changes in dendritic geometry during development and plasticity will critically affect propagation. By determining the spatial pattern of action potential signaling, dendritic morphology thus helps to define the size and interdependence of functional compartments in the neuron.},

abstract = {Exploring visual illusions reveals fundamental principles of cortical processing. Illusory motion perception of non-moving stimuli was described almost a century ago by Gestalt psychologists. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. To explore cortical mechanisms underlying the 'line-motion' illusion, we used real-time optical imaging, which is highly sensitive to subthreshold activity. We examined, in the visual cortex of the anaesthetized cat, responses to five stimuli: a stationary small square and a long bar; a moving square; a drawn-out bar; and the well-known line-motion illusion, a stationary square briefly preceding a long stationary bar presentation. Whereas flashing the bar alone evoked the expected localized, short latency and high amplitude activity patterns, presenting a square 60-100 ms before a bar induced the dynamic activity patterns resembling that of fast movement. The preceding square, even though physically non-moving, created gradually propagating subthreshold cortical activity that must contribute to illusory motion, because it was indistinguishable from cortical representations of real motion in this area. These findings demonstrate the effect of spatio-temporal patterns of subthreshold synaptic potentials on cortical processing and the shaping of perception.},

abstract = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex often appear to compute a weighted sum of the light intensity distribution of the visual stimuli that fall on their receptive fields. A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fail to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the linear responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well.},

Neurons physiologically identified as inhibitory and excitatory cells were used as templates for classification of all recorded neurons. Of the several parameters tested, the duration of the unfiltered (1 Hz to 5 kHz) spike provided the most reliable clustering of the population.

Evidence for this inhibition is commonly found in cross-orientation suppression: responses of a V1 neuron to optimally oriented bars are suppressed by superimposed mask bars of different orientation. We show, however, that suppression is unlikely to result from intracortical inhibition. First, suppression can be obtained with masks drifting too rapidly to elicit much of a response in cortex. Second, suppression is immune to hyperpolarization (through visual adaptation) of cortical neurons responding to the mask. Signals mediating suppression might originate in thalamus, rather than in cortex. Thalamic neurons exhibit some suppression; additional suppression might arise from depression at thalamocortical synapses. The mechanisms of suppression are subcortical and possibly include the very first synapse into cortex.},

This explanation correctly predicts that suppression is monocular, immune to cortical adaptation, and occurs for mask stimuli that elicit responses in the thalamus but not in the cortex. Depression also explains other phenomena previously ascribed to intracortical inhibition. It explains why responses saturate at high stimulus contrast, whereas selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency is invariant with contrast.

abstract = {The input conductance of cells in the cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown recently to grow substantially during visual stimulation. Because increasing conductance can have a divisive effect on the synaptic input, theoretical proposals have ascribed to it specific functions. According to the veto model, conductance increases would serve to sharpen orientation tuning by increasing most at off-optimal orientations. According to the normalization model, conductance increases would control the cell's gain, by being independent of stimulus orientation and by growing with stimulus contrast. We set out to test these proposals and to determine the visual properties and possible synaptic origin of the conductance increases. We recorded the membrane potential of cat V1 cells while injecting steady currents and presenting drifting grating patterns of varying contrast and orientation. Input conductance grew with stimulus contrast by 20-300{\%}, generally more in simple cells (40-300{\%}) than in complex cells (20-120{\%}), and in simple cells was strongly modulated in time. Conductance was invariably maximal for stimuli of the preferred orientation. Thus conductance changes contribute to a gain control mechanism, but the strength of this gain control does not depend uniquely on contrast. By assuming that the conductance changes are entirely synaptic, we further derived the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances underlying the visual responses. In simple cells, these conductances were often arranged in push-pull: excitation increased when inhibition decreased and vice versa. Excitation and inhibition had similar preferred orientations and did not appear to differ in tuning width, suggesting that the intracortical synaptic inputs to simple cells of cat V1 originate from cells with similar orientation tuning. This finding is at odds with models where orientation tuning in simple cells is achieved by inhibition at off-optimal orientations or sharpened by inhibition that is more broadly tuned than excitation.},

Activity in single and multiple inhibitory interneurons also significantly reduces postsynaptic membrane time constant and input resistance. These findings suggest that the time window for synaptic integration is a dynamic variable modulated by the level of tonic inhibition, and that rate coding and temporal coding strategies may be used in parallel in the same cell type.},

The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale.

Nevertheless the mechanism that underlies the so called Sharp Wave-Ripple complex (SPWR), observed in extracellular recordings in CA1, still remains elusive.

Both network models are computationally simple one-dimensional arrays of excitatory and inhibitory populations interacting only via fast chemical synapses. Connectivity schemes and postsynaptic potentials are based on physiological data, yielding a realistic network topology. The CA3 model exhibits quasi-synchronous population bursts, which give rise to sharp wave-like deep depolarizations in the CA1 dendritic layer accompanied by transient field oscillations at ≈ 150-200 Hz in the somatic layer. The frequency and synchrony of these oscillations is based on interneuronal activity and fast-decaying recurrent inhibition in CA1. Pyramidal cell spikes are sparse and come from a subset of cells receiving stronger than average excitatory input from CA3. The model is shown to accurately reproduce a large number of basic characteristics of SPWRs and yields a new mechanism for the generation of ripples, offering an interpretation to a range of neurophysiological observations, such as the ripple disruption by halothane and the selective firing of pyramidal cells during ripples, which may have implications for memory consolidation during SPWRs.},

@article{Gold2006,
abstract = {Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has the theoretical ability to report about what are typically considered intracellular features of the action potential. We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAPs, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.},

abstract = {Extracellular local field potentials are usually modeled as arising from a set of current sources embedded in a homogeneous extracellular medium. Although this formalism can successfully model several properties of extracellular local field potentials, it does not account for their frequency-dependent attenuation with distance, a property essential to correctly model extracellular spikes. Here we derive expressions for the extracellular potential that include this frequency-dependent attenuation. We first show that, if the extracellular conductivity is nonhomogeneous, there is induction of nonhomogeneous charge densities that may result in a low-pass filter. We next derive a simplified model consisting of a punctual (or spherical) current source with spherically symmetric conductivity/permittivity gradients around the source. We analyze the effect of different radial profiles of conductivity and permittivity on the frequency-filtering behavior of this model. We show that this simple model generally displays low-pass filtering behavior, in which fast electrical events (such as Na(+)-mediated action potentials) attenuate very steeply with distance, whereas slower (K(+)-mediated) events propagate over larger distances in extracellular space, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. This simple model can be used to obtain frequency-dependent extracellular field potentials without taking into account explicitly the complex folding of extracellular space.},

abstract = {We study analytically the dynamics of a network of sparsely connected inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons in a regime where individual neurons emit spikes irregularly and at a low rate. In the limit when the number of neurons --{\textgreater} infinity, the network exhibits a sharp transition between a stationary and an oscillatory global activity regime where neurons are weakly synchronized. The activity becomes oscillatory when the inhibitory feedback is strong enough. The period of the global oscillation is found to be mainly controlled by synaptic times but depends also on the characteristics of the external input. In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global oscillations of finite coherence time generically exist both above and below the critical inhibition threshold. Their characteristics are determined as functions of systems parameters in these two different regions. The results are found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations.},

abstract = {The effect of synaptic inputs on somatodendritic interactions during action potentials was investigated, in the cat, using in vivo intracellular recording and computational models of neocortical pyramidal cells. An array of 10 microelectrodes, each ending at a different cortical depth, was used to preferentially evoke synaptic inputs to different somatodendritic regions. Relative to action potentials evoked by current injection, spikes elicited by cortical microstimuli were reduced in amplitude and duration, with stimuli delivered at proximal (somatic) and distal (dendritic) levels evoking the largest and smallest decrements, respectively. When the inhibitory postsynaptic potential reversal was shifted to around -50 mV by recording with KCl pipettes, synaptically-evoked spikes were significantly less reduced than with potassium acetate or cesium acetate pipettes, suggesting that spike decrements are not only due to a shunt, but also to voltage-dependent effects. Computational models of neocortical pyramidal cells were built based on available data on the distribution of active currents and synaptic inputs in the soma and dendrites. The distribution of synapses activated by extracellular stimulation was estimated by matching the model to experimental recordings of postsynaptic potentials evoked at different depths. The model successfully reproduced the progressive spike amplitude reduction as a function of stimulation depth, as well as the effects of chloride and cesium. The model revealed that somatic spikes contain an important contribution from proximal dendritic sodium currents up to approximately 100 microm and approximately 300 microm from the soma under control and cesium conditions, respectively. Proximal inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can present this dendritic participation thus reducing the spike amplitude at the soma. The model suggests that the somatic spike amplitude and shape can be used as a "window" to infer the electrical participation of proximal dendrites. Thus, our results suggest that inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can control the participation of proximal dendrites in somatic sodium spikes.},

abstract = {Stimulus properties, attention, and behavioral context influence correlations between the spike times produced by a pair of neurons. However, the biophysical mechanisms that modulate these correlations are poorly understood. With a combined theoretical and experimental approach, we show that the rate of balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input modulates the magnitude and timescale of pairwise spike train correlation. High rate synaptic inputs promote spike time synchrony rather than long timescale spike rate correlations, while low rate synaptic inputs produce opposite results. This correlation shaping is due to a combination of enhanced high frequency input transfer and reduced firing rate gain in the high input rate state compared to the low state. Our study extends neural modulation from single neuron responses to population activity, a necessary step in understanding how the dynamics and processing of neural activity change across distinct brain states.},

abstract = {Ephaptic coupling refers to interactions between neurons mediated by current flow through the extracellular space. Ephaptic interactions between axons are considered negligible, because of the relatively large extracellular space and the layers of myelin that separate most axons. By contrast, olfactory nerve axons are unmyelinated and arranged in tightly packed bundles, features that may enhance ephaptic coupling. We tested the hypothesis that ephaptic interactions occur in the mammalian olfactory nerve with the use of a computational approach. Numerical solutions of models of axon fascicles show that significant ephaptic interactions occur for a range of physiologically relevant parameters. An action potential in a single axon can evoke action potentials in all other axons in the fascicle. Ephaptic interactions can also lead to synchronized firing of independently stimulated axons. Our findings suggest that ephaptic interactions may be significant determinants of the olfactory code and that such interactions may occur in other, similarly organized axonal or dendritic bundles.},

Compared to MUA, the LFP has greater spatial coherence, resulting in lower spatial specificity and lower stimulus selectivity. A differential propagation of low- and high-frequency electric signals supposedly underlies this phenomenon, which could result from cortical tissue specifically attenuating higher frequencies, i.e., from a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum. Here we directly measure the cortical impedance spectrum in vivo in monkey primary visual cortex. Our results show that impedance is independent of frequency, is homogeneous and tangentially isotropic within gray matter, and can be theoretically predicted assuming a pure-resistive conductor. We propose that the spatial summation of LFP and MUA is determined by the size of these signals' generators and the nature of neural events underlying them, rather than by biophysical properties of gray matter.},

We estimated the extracellular potentials associated with an action potential in a cortical pyramidal cell using standard one-dimensional cable theory and volume conductor theory. Their spatial and temporal pattern reveal much about the location and timing of currents in the cell, especially in combination with a known morphology, and simple experiments could resolve questions about spike initiation. From the extracellular potential we compute the ephaptically induced polarization in a nearby passive cable. The magnitude of this induced voltage can be several mV, does not spread electrotonically, and depends only weakly on the passive properties of the cable.

abstract = {We studied the dynamics of large networks of spiking neurons with conductance-based (nonlinear) synapses and compared them to networks with current-based (linear) synapses. For systems with sparse and inhibition-dominated recurrent connectivity, weak external inputs induced asynchronous irregular firing at low rates. Membrane potentials fluctuated a few millivolts below threshold, and membrane conductances were increased by a factor 2 to 5 with respect to the resting state. This combination of parameters characterizes the ongoing spiking activity typically recorded in the cortex in vivo. Many aspects of the asynchronous irregular state in conductance-based networks could be sufficiently well characterized with a simple numerical mean field approach. In particular, it correctly predicted an intriguing property of conductance-based networks that does not appear to be shared by current-based models: they exhibit states of low-rate asynchronous irregular activity that persist for some period of time even in the absence of external inputs and without cortical pacemakers. Simulations of larger networks (up to 350,000 neurons) demonstrated that the survival time of self-sustained activity increases exponentially with network size.},

abstract = {Brain activity generates extracellular voltage fluctuations recorded as local field potentials (LFPs). It is known that the relevant microvariables, the ionic currents across membranes, jointly generate the macrovariables, the extracellular voltage, but neither the detailed biophysical knowledge nor the required computational power have been available to model these processes. We simulated the LFP in a model of the rodent neocortical column composed of {\textgreater}12,000 reconstructed, multicompartmental, and spiking cortical layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons and basket cells, including five million dendritic and somatic compartments with voltage- and ion-dependent currents, realistic connectivity, and probabilistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. We found that, depending on a number of factors, the LFP reflects local and cross-layer processing. Active currents dominate the generation of LFPs, not synaptic ones. Spike-related currents impact the LFP not only at higher frequencies but below 50 Hz. This work calls for re-evaluating the genesis of LFPs.},

abstract = {Synaptic noise due to intense network activity can have a significant impact on the electrophysiological properties of individual neurons. This is the case for the cerebral cortex, where ongoing activity leads to strong barrages of synaptic inputs, which act as the main source of synaptic noise affecting on neuronal dynamics. Here, we characterize the subthreshold behavior of neuronal models in which synaptic noise is represented by either additive or multiplicative noise, described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We derive and solve the Fokker-Planck equation for this system, which describes the time evolution of the probability density function for the membrane potential. We obtain an analytic expression for the membrane potential distribution at steady state and compare this expression with the subthreshold activity obtained in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models with stochastic synaptic inputs. The differences between multiplicative and additive noise models suggest that multiplicative noise is adequate to describe the high-conductance states similar to in vivo conditions. Because the steady-state membrane potential distribution is easily obtained experimentally, this approach provides a possible method to estimate the mean and variance of synaptic conductances in real neurons.},

abstract = {The magnitude of correlations between stimulus-driven responses of pairs of neurons can itself be stimulus dependent. We examine how this dependence affects the information carried by neural populations about the stimuli that drive them. Stimulus-dependent changes in correlations can both carry information directly and modulate the information separately carried by the firing rates and variances. We use Fisher information to quantify these effects and show that, although stimulus-dependent correlations often carry little information directly, their modulatory effects on the overall information can be large. In particular, if the stimulus dependence is such that correlations increase with stimulus-induced firing rates, this can significantly enhance the information of the population when the structure of correlations is determined solely by the stimulus. However, in the presence of additional strong spatial decay of correlations, such stimulus dependence may have a negative impact. Opposite relationships hold when correlations decrease with firing rates.},

In this paper we demonstrate that activity-dependent attenuations in amplitude occur during behavior and that the amount of attenuation is reduced with an animal's experience in an environment. The observed reductions are caused by an animal's experience within a specific environmental context, are dependent on functional NMDA receptors, and are accompanied by an increase in the effective coupling of pyramidal cells and interneurons. These results provide an important step in linking together in vivo studies with in vitro data and suggest that mechanisms of plasticity engaged during behavior may be sufficient to alter the biophysical and integrative properties of hippocampal pyramidal cells.},

We give closed-form estimates for the equilibrium distribution, mean rate, variance, and autocorrelation function of the network activity. The model is applicable to any network where the probability of firing of a neuron in the network depends on only the number of neurons that fired in a previous temporal epoch. Networks with statistically homogeneous connectivity and membrane and synaptic time constants that are not excessively long could satisfy these conditions. Our model completely accounts for the size of the network and correlations in the firing activity. It also allows us to examine how the network dynamics can deviate from mean field theory.

@article{Zhu2006,
abstract = {It is believed that both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms are essential in neural learning. While Hebbian plasticity selectively modifies synaptic connectivity according to activity experienced, homeostatic plasticity constrains this change so that neural activity is always within reasonable physiological limits. Recent experiments reveal spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as a new type of Hebbian learning with high time precision and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) as a new homeostatic mechanism acting directly on synapses. Here, we study the effect of STDP and HSP on randomly connected neural networks. Despite the reported successes of STDP to account for neural activities at the single-cell level, we find that, surprisingly, at the network level, networks trained using STDP alone cannot seem to generate realistic neural activities. For instance, STDP would stipulate that past sensory experience be maintained forever if it is no longer activated. To overcome this difficulty, motivated by the fact that HSP can induce strong competition between sensory experiences, we propose a biophysically plausible learning rule by combining STDP and HSP. Based on the Fokker-Planck theory and extensive numerical computations, we demonstrate that HSP and STDP operated on different time scales can complement each other, resulting in more realistic network activities. Our finding may provide fresh insight into the learning mechanism of the brain.},

abstract = {Neural circuits display complex activity patterns both spontaneously and when responding to a stimulus or generating a motor output. How are these two forms of activity related? We develop a procedure called FORCE learning for modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired activity patterns. FORCE learning works even though the networks we train are spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during learning. Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than generally appreciated.},

abstract = {Various types of neural-based signals, such as EEG, local field potentials and intracellular synaptic potentials, integrate multiple sources of activity distributed across large assemblies. They have in common a power-law frequency-scaling structure at high frequencies, but it is still unclear whether this scaling property is dominated by intrinsic neuronal properties or by network activity. The latter case is particularly interesting because if frequency-scaling reflects the network state it could be used to characterize the functional impact of the connectivity. In intracellularly recorded neurons of cat primary visual cortex in vivo, the power spectral density of V(m) activity displays a power-law structure at high frequencies with a fractional scaling exponent. We show that this exponent is not constant, but depends on the visual statistics used to drive the network. To investigate the determinants of this frequency-scaling, we considered a generic recurrent model of cortex receiving a retinotopically organized external input. Similarly to the in vivo case, our in computo simulations show that the scaling exponent reflects the correlation level imposed in the input. This systematic dependence was also replicated at the single cell level, by controlling independently, in a parametric way, the strength and the temporal decay of the pairwise correlation between presynaptic inputs. This last model was implemented in vitro by imposing the correlation control in artificial presynaptic spike trains through dynamic-clamp techniques. These in vitro manipulations induced a modulation of the scaling exponent, similar to that observed in vivo and predicted in computo. We conclude that the frequency-scaling exponent of the V(m) reflects stimulus-driven correlations in the cortical network activity. Therefore, we propose that the scaling exponent could be used to read-out the "effective" connectivity responsible for the dynamical signature of the population signals measured at different integration levels, from Vm to LFP, EEG and fMRI.},

Here we discuss a distinct form of information representation, the local distribution of spike intervals, and show that the time-varying distribution of interspike intervals (ISIs) can represent parameters of the statistical context of stimuli. For many sensory neural systems the mapping between the stimulus input and spiking output is not fixed but, rather, depends on the statistical properties of the stimulus, potentially leading to ambiguity. We have shown previously that for the adaptive neural code of the fly H1, a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system, information about the overall variance of the signal is obtainable from the ISI distribution. We now demonstrate the decoding of information about variance and show that a distributional code of ISIs can resolve ambiguities introduced by slow spike frequency adaptation. We examine the precision of this distributional code for the representation of stimulus variance in the H1 neuron as well as in the Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron. We find that the accuracy of the decoding depends on the shapes of the ISI distributions and the speed with which they adapt to new stimulus variances.},

abstract = {Proper functioning of working memory involves the expression of stimulus-selective persistent activity in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which refers to neural activity that persists for seconds beyond the end of the stimulus. The mechanisms which PFC pyramidal neurons use to discriminate between preferred vs. neutral inputs at the cellular level are largely unknown. Moreover, the presence of pyramidal cell subtypes with different firing patterns, such as regular spiking and intrinsic bursting, raises the question as to what their distinct role might be in persistent firing in the PFC. Here, we use a compartmental modeling approach to search for discriminatory features in the properties of incoming stimuli to a PFC pyramidal neuron and/or its response that signal which of these stimuli will result in persistent activity emergence. Furthermore, we use our modeling approach to study cell-type specific differences in persistent activity properties, via implementing a regular spiking (RS) and an intrinsic bursting (IB) model neuron. We identify synaptic location within the basal dendrites as a feature of stimulus selectivity. Specifically, persistent activity-inducing stimuli consist of activated synapses that are located more distally from the soma compared to non-inducing stimuli, in both model cells. In addition, the action potential (AP) latency and the first few inter-spike-intervals of the neuronal response can be used to reliably detect inducing vs. non-inducing inputs, suggesting a potential mechanism by which downstream neurons can rapidly decode the upcoming emergence of persistent activity. While the two model neurons did not differ in the coding features of persistent activity emergence, the properties of persistent activity, such as the firing pattern and the duration of temporally-restricted persistent activity were distinct. Collectively, our results pinpoint to specific features of the neuronal response to a given stimulus that code for its ability to induce persistent activity and predict differential roles of RS and IB neurons in persistent activity expression.},

abstract = {The modulation of the sensitivity, or gain, of neural responses to input is an important component of neural computation. It has been shown that divisive gain modulation of neural responses can result from a stochastic shunting from balanced (mixed excitation and inhibition) background activity. This gain control scheme was developed and explored with static inputs, where the membrane and spike train statistics were stationary in time. However, input statistics, such as the firing rates of pre-synaptic neurons, are often dynamic, varying on timescales comparable to typical membrane time constants. Using a population density approach for integrate-and-fire neurons with dynamic and temporally rich inputs, we find that the same fluctuation-induced divisive gain modulation is operative for dynamic inputs driving nonequilibrium responses. Moreover, the degree of divisive scaling of the dynamic response is quantitatively the same as the steady-state responses--thus, gain modulation via balanced conductance fluctuations generalizes in a straight-forward way to a dynamic setting.},

abstract = {Gain modulation, in which the sensitivity of a neural response to one input is modified by a second input, is studied at single-neuron and network levels. At the single neuron level, gain modulation can arise if the two inputs are subject to a direct multiplicative interaction. Alternatively, these inputs can be summed in a linear manner by the neuron and gain modulation can arise, instead, from a nonlinear input-output relationship. We derive a mathematical constraint that can distinguish these two mechanisms even though they can look very similar, provided sufficient data of the appropriate type are available. Previously, it has been shown in coordinate transformation studies that artificial neurons with sigmoid transfer functions can acquire a nonlinear additive form of gain modulation through learning-driven adjustment of synaptic weights. We use the constraint derived for single-neuron studies to compare responses in this network with those of another network model based on a biologically inspired transfer function that can support approximately multiplicative interactions.},

abstract = {Modulating the gain of the input-output function of neurons is critical for processing of stimuli and network dynamics. Previous gain control mechanisms have suggested that voltage fluctuations play a key role in determining neuronal gain in vivo. Here we show that, under increased membrane conductance, voltage fluctuations restore Na(+) current and reduce spike frequency adaptation in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. As a consequence, membrane voltage fluctuations produce a leftward shift in the frequency-current relationship without a change in gain, relative to an increase in conductance alone. Furthermore, we show that these changes have important implications for the integration of inhibitory inputs. Due to the ability to restore Na(+) current, hyperpolarizing membrane voltage fluctuations mediated by GABA(A)-like inputs can increase firing rate in a high-conductance state. Finally, our data show that the effects on gain and synaptic integration are mediated by voltage fluctuations within a physiologically relevant range of frequencies (10-40 Hz).},

abstract = {The role of irregular cortical firing in neuronal computation is still debated, and it is unclear how signals carried by fluctuating synaptic potentials are decoded by downstream neurons. We examined in vitro frequency versus current (f-I) relationships of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using fluctuating stimuli. Studies in the somatosensory cortex show that L5 neurons become insensitive to input fluctuations as input mean increases and that their f-I response becomes linear. In contrast, our results show that mPFC L5 pyramidal neurons retain an increased sensitivity to input fluctuations, whereas their sensitivity to the input mean diminishes to near zero. This implies that the discharge properties of L5 mPFC neurons are well suited to encode input fluctuations rather than input mean in their firing rates, with important consequences for information processing and stability of persistent activity at the network level.},

@article{Hong2012,
abstract = {Correlated spiking has been widely observed, but its impact on neural coding remains controversial. Correlation arising from comodulation of rates across neurons has been shown to vary with the firing rates of individual neurons. This translates into rate and correlation being equivalently tuned to the stimulus; under those conditions, correlated spiking does not provide information beyond that already available from individual neuron firing rates. Such correlations are irrelevant and can reduce coding efficiency by introducing redundancy. Using simulations and experiments in rat hippocampal neurons, we show here that pairs of neurons receiving correlated input also exhibit correlations arising from precise spike-time synchronization. Contrary to rate comodulation, spike-time synchronization is unaffected by firing rate, thus enabling synchrony- and rate-based coding to operate independently. The type of output correlation depends on whether intrinsic neuron properties promote integration or coincidence detection: "ideal" integrators (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus mean) exhibit rate comodulation, whereas ideal coincidence detectors (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus variance) exhibit precise spike-time synchronization. Pyramidal neurons are sensitive to both stimulus mean and variance, and thus exhibit both types of output correlation proportioned according to which operating mode is dominant. Our results explain how different types of correlations arise based on how individual neurons generate spikes, and why spike-time synchronization and rate comodulation can encode different stimulus properties. Our results also highlight the importance of neuronal properties for population-level coding insofar as neural networks can employ different coding schemes depending on the dominant operating mode of their constituent neurons.},

abstract = {Multi-site field potential and intracellular recordings from various neocortical areas were used to study very fast oscillations or ripples (80-200 Hz) during electrographic seizures in cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. The animals displayed spontaneously occurring and electrically induced seizures comprising spike-wave complexes (2-3 Hz) and fast runs (10-20 Hz). Neocortical ripples had much higher amplitudes during seizures than during the slow oscillation preceding the onset of seizures. A series of experimental data from the present study supports the hypothesis that ripples are implicated in seizure initiation. Ripples were particularly strong at the onset of seizures and halothane, which antagonizes the occurrence of ripples, also blocked seizures. The firing of electrophysiologically defined cellular types was phase-locked with ripples in simultaneously recorded field potentials. This indicates that ripples during paroxysmal events are associated with a coordination of firing in a majority of neocortical neurons. This was confirmed with dual intracellular recordings. Based on the amplitude that neocortical ripples reach during paroxysmal events, we propose a mechanism by which neocortical ripples during normal network activity could actively participate in the initiation of seizures on reaching a certain threshold amplitude. This mechanism involves a vicious feedback loop in which very fast oscillations in field potentials are a reflection of synchronous action potentials, and in turn these oscillations help generate and synchronize action potentials in adjacent neurons through electrical interactions.},

Although many similarities between spontaneous and sensory-evoked neocortical activity have been reported, little is known about consistent differences between them. Here, using simultaneously recorded cortical populations and morphologically identified pyramidal cells, we compare the laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in rat auditory cortex. Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.},

A series of experiments demonstrate the involvement of the direct corticocortical feedback pathway, providing temporally precise and spatially targeted modulation of network dynamics. Cortically mediated changes in network state significantly impact sensory coding, with activated states increasing the reliability of responses to complex stimuli.

abstract = {Cortical dynamics can be imaged at high spatiotemporal resolution with voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) and calcium-sensitive dyes (CaSDs). We combined these two imaging techniques using epifluorescence optics together with whole cell recordings to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity in the mouse somatosensory barrel cortex in vitro and in the supragranular layers in vivo. The two optical signals reported distinct aspects of cortical function. VSD fluorescence varied linearly with membrane potential and was dominated by subthreshold postsynaptic potentials, whereas the CaSD signal predominantly reflected local action potential firing. Combining VSDs and CaSDs allowed us to monitor the synaptic drive and the spiking activity of a given area at the same time in the same preparation. The spatial extent of the two dye signals was different, with VSD signals spreading further than CaSD signals, reflecting broad subthreshold and narrow suprathreshold receptive fields. Importantly, the signals from the dyes were differentially affected by pharmacological manipulations, stimulation strength, and depth of isoflurane anesthesia. Combined VSD and CaSD measurements can therefore be used to specify the temporal and spatial relationships between subthreshold and suprathreshold activity of the neocortex.},

To perform a quantitative analysis of the relative contributions to the VSD signal, a detailed compartmental model was developed at a scale corresponding to one pixel of optical imaging. The generated model was used to solve the VSD direct problem, i.e. generate a VSD signal, given the neural substrate parameters and activities. Here, we confirm and quantify the fact that the VSD signal is the result of an average from multiple components. Not surprisingly, the compartments that mostly contribute to the signal are the upper layer dendrites of excitatory neurons. However, our model suggests that inhibitory cells, spiking activity and deep layers contributions are also significant and, more unexpected, are dynamically modulated with time and response strength. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Tactile information is actively acquired and processed in the brain through concerted interactions between movement and sensation. Somatosensory input is often the result of self-generated movement during the active touch of objects, and conversely, sensory information is used to refine motor control. There must therefore be important interactions between sensory and motor pathways, which we chose to investigate in the mouse whisker sensorimotor system. Voltage-sensitive dye was applied to the neocortex of mice to directly image the membrane potential dynamics of sensorimotor cortex with subcolumnar spatial resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Single brief whisker deflections evoked highly distributed depolarizing cortical sensory responses, which began in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex and subsequently excited the whisker motor cortex. The spread of sensory information to motor cortex was dynamically regulated by behavior and correlated with the generation of sensory-evoked whisker movement. Sensory processing in motor cortex may therefore contribute significantly to active tactile sensory perception. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Tan2014,
abstract = {In the mammalian cerebral cortex, neural responses are highly variable during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. To explain this variability, the cortex of alert animals has been proposed to be in an asynchronous high-conductance state in which irregular spiking arises from the convergence of large numbers of uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto individual neurons. Signatures of this state are that a neuron's membrane potential (Vm) hovers just below spike threshold, and its aggregate synaptic input is nearly Gaussian, arising from many uncorrelated inputs. Alternatively, irregular spiking could arise from infrequent correlated input events that elicit large fluctuations in Vm (refs 5, 6). To distinguish between these hypotheses, we developed a technique to perform whole-cell Vm measurements from the cortex of behaving monkeys, focusing on primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a visual fixation task. Here we show that, contrary to the predictions of an asynchronous state, mean Vm during fixation was far from threshold (14 mV) and spiking was triggered by occasional large spontaneous fluctuations. Distributions of Vm values were skewed beyond that expected for a range of Gaussian input, but were consistent with synaptic input arising from infrequent correlated events. Furthermore, spontaneous fluctuations in Vm were correlated with the surrounding network activity, as reflected in simultaneously recorded nearby local field potential. Visual stimulation, however, led to responses more consistent with an asynchronous state: mean Vm approached threshold, fluctuations became more Gaussian, and correlations between single neurons and the surrounding network were disrupted. These observations show that sensory drive can shift a common cortical circuitry from a synchronous to an asynchronous state.},

Experimental work shows that these properties vary considerably across identified neurons in different animals. Given this variability in experimental data, this review describes some of the complications of building computational models to aid in understanding how system dynamics arise from the interaction of system components. We argue that instead of trying to build a single model that captures the generic behavior of a neuron or circuit, it is beneficial to construct a population of models that captures the behavior of the population that provided the experimental data. Studying a population of models with different underlying structure and similar behaviors provides opportunities to discover unsuspected compensatory mechanisms that contribute to neuron and network function.},

abstract = {Asynchronous activity in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is believed to constitute the primary medium for the propagation and transformation of information in the neocortex. Here we show that an unstructured, sparsely connected network of model spiking neurons can display two fundamentally different types of asynchronous activity that imply vastly different computational properties. For weak synaptic couplings, the network at rest is in the well-studied asynchronous state, in which individual neurons fire irregularly at constant rates. In this state, an external input leads to a highly redundant response of different neurons that favors information transmission but hinders more complex computations. For strong couplings, we find that the network at rest displays rich internal dynamics, in which the firing rates of individual neurons fluctuate strongly in time and across neurons. In this regime, the internal dynamics interact with incoming stimuli to provide a substrate for complex information processing and learning.},

abstract = {Dendrites form the major components of neurons. They are complex branching structures that receive and process thousands of synaptic inputs from other neurons. It is well known that dendritic morphology plays an important role in the function of dendrites. Another important contribution to the response characteristics of a single neuron comes from the intrinsic resonant properties of dendritic membrane. In this paper we combine the effects of dendritic branching and resonant membrane dynamics by generalising the "sum-over-trips" approach (Abbott et al. in Biol Cybernetics 66, 49-60 1991). To illustrate how this formalism can shed light on the role of architecture and resonances in determining neuronal output we consider dual recording and reconstruction data from a rat CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cell. Specifically we explore the way in which an Ih current contributes to a voltage overshoot at the soma.},

abstract = {The results of studies on modulation of Na channel function are often difficult to interpret due to time-dependent changes in channel kinetics. Although the "tight-seal" whole cell voltage-clamp technique has proved very useful in studying the properties of the cardiac Na current, the spontaneous shift of parameters of inactivation and activation gating to more negative potential is a serious limitation to the use of the technique. The shifts are believed to result from changes in the intracellular milieu effected by dialysis; moreover, use of a variety of different anions and cations in the internal micropipette solution has not obviated the problem. The perforated-patch technique permits low-resistance intracellular access without free dialysis between the intracellular solution and the recording micropipette. We have compared steady-state inactivation and peak current-voltage relationship of whole cell Na currents measured with the conventional whole cell and perforated-patch techniques in rabbit atrial myocytes at 17 degrees C. Although gating parameters shifted to more negative potentials when recorded with the conventional technique, stable kinetics could be observed for up to 150 min with the perforated-patch technique. The potential for one-half Na channel inactivation was -73 +/- 5.1 mV and is consistent with measurements made using indirect techniques such as upstroke velocity measurements. The fact that the intracellular milieu is left relatively intact makes the approach attractive for studying modulation of the Na current by neurotransmitters and hormones.},

The low success rate and short recording times limit in vitro experimentation on mouse spinal networks to neonatal and early postnatal periods when locomotor networks are still developmentally immature. To overcome this limitation and enable investigation of mature locomotor network neurons, we have established a reliable procedure to record from spinal cord neurons in slices from adult, behaviorally mature mice of any age. Two key changes to the established neonate procedure were implemented. First, we remove the cord by a dorsal laminectomy from a deeply anesthetized animal. This enables respiration and other vital functions to continue up to the moment the maximally oxygenated lumbar spinal cord is removed, improving the health of the slices. Second, since adult spinal cord interneurons appear more sensitive to the intracellular dialysis that occurs during whole cell recordings, we introduced perforated patch recordings to the procedure. Stable recordings up to 12 h in duration were obtained with our new method. This will allow investigation of changes in mature neuronal properties in disease states or after spinal cord injury and allow prolonged recordings of responses to drug application that were previously impossible.},

abstract = {Neurons are spatially extended structures that receive and process inputs on their dendrites. It is generally accepted that neuronal computations arise from the active integration of synaptic inputs along a dendrite between the input location and the location of spike generation in the axon initial segment. However, many application such as simulations of brain networks use point-neurons-neurons without a morphological component-as computational units to keep the conceptual complexity and computational costs low. Inevitably, these applications thus omit a fundamental property of neuronal computation. In this work, we present an approach to model an artificial synapse that mimics dendritic processing without the need to explicitly simulate dendritic dynamics. The model synapse employs an analytic solution for the cable equation to compute the neuron's membrane potential following dendritic inputs. Green's function formalism is used to derive the closed version of the cable equation. We show that by using this synapse model, point-neurons can achieve results that were previously limited to the realms of multi-compartmental models. Moreover, a computational advantage is achieved when only a small number of simulated synapses impinge on a morphologically elaborate neuron. Opportunities and limitations are discussed.},

In visual cortex (V1), ongoing activity is present in vivo, and spiking responses to simple stimuli are highly unreliable across trials. Stimulus statistics used to plot receptive fields, however, are quite different from those experienced during natural visuomotor exploration. We recorded V1 neurons intracellularly in the anaesthetized and paralyzed cat and compared their spiking and synaptic responses to full field natural images animated by simulated eye-movements to those evoked by simpler (grating) or higher dimensionality statistics (dense noise). In most cells, natural scene animation was the only condition where high temporal precision (in the 10-20 ms range) was maintained during sparse and reliable activity. At the subthreshold level, irregular but highly reproducible membrane potential dynamics were observed, even during long (several 100 ms) "spike-less" periods. We showed that both the spatial structure of natural scenes and the temporal dynamics of eye-movements increase the signal-to-noise ratio by a non-linear amplification of the signal combined with a reduction of the subthreshold contextual noise. These data support the view that the sparsening and the time precision of the neural code in V1 may depend primarily on three factors: (1) broadband input spectrum: the bandwidth must be rich enough for recruiting optimally the diversity of spatial and time constants during recurrent processing; (2) tight temporal interplay of excitation and inhibition: conductance measurements demonstrate that natural scene statistics narrow selectively the duration of the spiking opportunity window during which the balance between excitation and inhibition changes transiently and reversibly; (3) signal energy in the lower frequency band: a minimal level of power is needed below 10 Hz to reach consistently the spiking threshold, a situation rarely reached with visual dense noise.},

abstract = {Perforated patch recordings of neuronal calcium currents (I(Ca)) with amphotericin B or nystatin reduce dialysis of intracellular constituents and current rundown, but can be difficult and frequently unsuccessful. We investigated the saponin beta-escin as a putative ionophore for perforated patch I(Ca) recordings in acutely dissociated, rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. I(Ca) was recorded in time-course studies after including either beta-escin (50 microM), or amphotericin B (240 microg/ml) as perforating ionophores in the internal pipette solution, in comparison to standard ruptured-patch technique, using suction. Perforated patches were allowed to take place spontaneously. The percentage loss of I(Ca) per min (within the first 20 min) was significantly less after beta-escin (0.0518{\%}) (n = 18), versus either amphotericin (1.82{\%}) (n = 12) or standard patch (4.52{\%}) (n = 7), (P {\textless} 0.001). The slope of the rundown after linear fit was also less after beta-escin (P {\textless} 0.001). Minimal "steady-state" access resistance (R(a)) of 6.6 +/- 1.6 MOmega was achieved within 7.1 +/- 9.3 min following perforation with beta-escin, 7.9 +/- 3.5 MOmega within 44 =/- 14 min after amphotericin B, and 6.8 +/- 1.9 MOmega with standard patch (P {\textless} 0.05 for R(a), and P {\textless} 0.01 for permeabilization time, respectively). Success rates were 59{\%} with beta-escin versus 27{\%} with amphotericin. Leak {\textgreater}10{\%} of peak I(Ca) was present in 25{\%} of cells after beta-escin versus 20{\%} after amphotericin, and 12{\%} after standard technique. Perforated patches using beta-escin were stable for 15-60 min. We conclude that beta-escin may be used as an alternative ionophore for perforated patch-clamp studies in neurons, and results in minimal rundown that can facilitate long-term recordings of I(Ca). Limited rundown may be due to better preservation of cytosolic ATP content.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons process nociceptive information and their excitability is partly determined by the properties of voltage-gated sodium channels. Recently, we showed the excitability and action potential properties of mouse SDH neurons change markedly during early postnatal development. Here we compare sodium currents generated in neonate (P0-5) and young adult (≥P21) SDH neurons.

RESULTS: Whole cell recordings were obtained from lumbar SDH neurons in transverse spinal cord slices (CsF internal, 32°C). Fast activating and inactivating TTX-sensitive inward currents were evoked by depolarization from a holding potential of -100 mV. Poorly clamped currents, based on a deflection in the IV relationship at potentials between -60 and -50 mV, were not accepted for analysis. Current density and decay time increased significantly between the first and third weeks of postnatal development, whereas time to peak was similar at both ages. This was accompanied by more subtle changes in activation range and steady state inactivation. Recovery from inactivation was slower and TTX-sensitivity was reduced in young adult neurons.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests sodium channel expression changes markedly during early postnatal development in mouse SDH neurons. The methods employed in this study can now be applied to future investigations of spinal cord sodium channel plasticity in murine pain models.},

abstract = {Computational models offer a unique tool for understanding the network-dynamical mechanisms which mediate between physiological and biophysical properties, and behavioral function. A traditional challenge in computational neuroscience is, however, that simple neuronal models which can be studied analytically fail to reproduce the diversity of electrophysiological behaviors seen in real neurons, while detailed neuronal models which do reproduce such diversity are intractable analytically and computationally expensive. A number of intermediate models have been proposed whose aim is to capture the diversity of firing behaviors and spike times of real neurons while entailing the simplest possible mathematical description. One such model is the exponential integrate-and-fire neuron with spike rate adaptation (aEIF) which consists of two differential equations for the membrane potential (V) and an adaptation current (w). Despite its simplicity, it can reproduce a wide variety of physiologically observed spiking patterns, can be fit to physiological recordings quantitatively, and, once done so, is able to predict spike times on traces not used for model fitting. Here we compute the steady-state firing rate of aEIF in the presence of Gaussian synaptic noise, using two approaches. The first approach is based on the 2-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that describes the (V,w)-probability distribution, which is solved using an expansion in the ratio between the time constants of the two variables. The second is based on the firing rate of the EIF model, which is averaged over the distribution of the w variable. These analytically derived closed-form expressions were tested on simulations from a large variety of model cells quantitatively fitted to in vitro electrophysiological recordings from pyramidal cells and interneurons. Theoretical predictions closely agreed with the firing rate of the simulated cells fed with in-vivo-like synaptic noise.},

We propose a simple stochastic process that is able to capture the observed playing statistics and show that the Zipf law arises from the self-similar nature of the game tree of chess. Thus, in the case of hierarchical fragmentation the scaling is truly universal and independent of a particular generating mechanism.

abstract = {Correlated neuronal activity is a natural consequence of network connectivity and shared inputs to pairs of neurons, but the task-dependent modulation of correlations in relation to behavior also hints at a functional role. Correlations influence the gain of postsynaptic neurons, the amount of information encoded in the population activity and decoded by readout neurons, and synaptic plasticity. Further, it affects the power and spatial reach of extracellular signals like the local-field potential. A theory of correlated neuronal activity accounting for recurrent connectivity as well as fluctuating external sources is currently lacking. In particular, it is unclear how the recently found mechanism of active decorrelation by negative feedback on the population level affects the network response to externally applied correlated stimuli. Here, we present such an extension of the theory of correlations in stochastic binary networks. We show that (1) for homogeneous external input, the structure of correlations is mainly determined by the local recurrent connectivity, (2) homogeneous external inputs provide an additive, unspecific contribution to the correlations, (3) inhibitory feedback effectively decorrelates neuronal activity, even if neurons receive identical external inputs, and (4) identical synaptic input statistics to excitatory and to inhibitory cells increases intrinsically generated fluctuations and pairwise correlations. We further demonstrate how the accuracy of mean-field predictions can be improved by self-consistently including correlations. As a byproduct, we show that the cancellation of correlations between the summed inputs to pairs of neurons does not originate from the fast tracking of external input, but from the suppression of fluctuations on the population level by the local network. This suppression is a necessary constraint, but not sufficient to determine the structure of correlations; specifically, the structure observed at finite network size differs from the prediction based on perfect tracking, even though perfect tracking implies suppression of population fluctuations.},

abstract = {Firing-rate models provide a practical tool for studying the dynamics of trial- or population-averaged neuronal signals. A wealth of theoretical and experimental studies has been dedicated to the derivation or extraction of such models by investigating the firing-rate response characteristics of ensembles of neurons. The majority of these studies assumes that neurons receive input spikes at a high rate through weak synapses (diffusion approximation). For many biological neural systems, however, this assumption cannot be justified. So far, it is unclear how time-varying presynaptic firing rates are transmitted by a population of neurons if the diffusion assumption is dropped. Here, we numerically investigate the stationary and non-stationary firing-rate response properties of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons receiving input spikes through excitatory synapses with alpha-function shaped postsynaptic currents for strong synaptic weights. Input spike trains are modeled by inhomogeneous Poisson point processes with sinusoidal rate. Average rates, modulation amplitudes, and phases of the period-averaged spike responses are measured for a broad range of stimulus, synapse, and neuron parameters. Across wide parameter regions, the resulting transfer functions can be approximated by a linear first-order low-pass filter. Below a critical synaptic weight, the cutoff frequencies are approximately constant and determined by the synaptic time constants. Only for synapses with unrealistically strong weights are the cutoff frequencies significantly increased. To account for stimuli with larger modulation depths, we combine the measured linear transfer function with the nonlinear response characteristics obtained for stationary inputs. The resulting linear-nonlinear model accurately predicts the population response for a variety of non-sinusoidal stimuli.},

abstract = {Firing-rate models provide a practical tool for studying signal processing in the early visual system, permitting more thorough mathematical analysis than spike-based models. We show here that essential response properties of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) can be captured by surprisingly simple firing-rate models consisting of a low-pass filter and a nonlinear activation function. The starting point for our analysis are two spiking neuron models based on experimental data: a spike-response model fitted to data from macaque (Carandini et al. J. Vis., 20(14), 1-2011, 2007), and a model with conductance-based synapses and afterhyperpolarizing currents fitted to data from cat (Casti et al. J. Comput. Neurosci., 24(2), 235-252, 2008). We obtained the nonlinear activation function by stimulating the model neurons with stationary stochastic spike trains, while we characterized the linear filter by fitting a low-pass filter to responses to sinusoidally modulated stochastic spike trains. To account for the non-Poisson nature of retinal spike trains, we performed all analyses with spike trains with higher-order gamma statistics in addition to Poissonian spike trains. Interestingly, the properties of the low-pass filter depend only on the average input rate, but not on the modulation depth of sinusoidally modulated input. Thus, the response properties of our model are fully specified by just three parameters (low-frequency gain, cutoff frequency, and delay) for a given mean input rate and input regularity. This simple firing-rate model reproduces the response of spiking neurons to a step in input rate very well for Poissonian as well as for non-Poissonian input. We also found that the cutoff frequencies, and thus the filter time constants, of the rate-based model are unrelated to the membrane time constants of the underlying spiking models, in agreement with similar observations for simpler models.},

abstract = {Anatomical studies demonstrate that excitatory connections in cortex are not uniformly distributed across a network but instead exhibit clustering into groups of highly connected neurons. The implications of clustering for cortical activity are unclear. We studied the effect of clustered excitatory connections on the dynamics of neuronal networks that exhibited high spike time variability owing to a balance between excitation and inhibition. Even modest clustering substantially changed the behavior of these networks, introducing slow dynamics during which clusters of neurons transiently increased or decreased their firing rate. Consequently, neurons exhibited both fast spiking variability and slow firing rate fluctuations. A simplified model shows how stimuli bias networks toward particular activity states, thereby reducing firing rate variability as observed experimentally in many cortical areas. Our model thus relates cortical architecture to the reported variability in spontaneous and evoked spiking activity.},

abstract = {The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region in neurons where action potentials are initiated. It is commonly assumed that this process requires a high density of voltage-gated sodium (Na(+)) channels. Paradoxically, the results of patch-clamp studies suggest that the Na(+) channel density at the AIS is similar to that at the soma and proximal dendrites. Here we provide data obtained by antibody staining, whole-cell voltage-clamp and Na(+) imaging, together with modeling, which indicate that the Na(+) channel density at the AIS of cortical pyramidal neurons is approximately 50 times that in the proximal dendrites. Anchoring of Na(+) channels to the cytoskeleton can explain this discrepancy, as disruption of the actin cytoskeleton increased the Na(+) current measured in patches from the AIS. Computational models required a high Na(+) channel density (approximately 2,500 pS microm(-2)) at the AIS to account for observations on action potential generation and backpropagation.

abstract = {Different patterns of channel activity have been detected by patch clamping excised membrane patches from reconstituted giant liposomes containing purified KcsA, a potassium channel from prokaryotes. The more frequent pattern has a characteristic low channel opening probability and exhibits many other features reported for KcsA reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, including a moderate voltage dependence, blockade by Na(+), and a strict dependence on acidic pH for channel opening. The predominant gating event in this low channel opening probability pattern corresponds to the positive coupling of two KcsA channels. However, other activity patterns have been detected as well, which are characterized by a high channel opening probability (HOP patterns), positive coupling of mostly five concerted channels, and profound changes in other KcsA features, including a different voltage dependence, channel opening at neutral pH, and lack of Na(+) blockade. The above functional diversity occurs correlatively to the heterogeneous supramolecular assembly of KcsA into clusters. Clustering of KcsA depends on protein concentration and occurs both in detergent solution and more markedly in reconstituted membranes, including giant liposomes, where some of the clusters are large enough (up to micrometer size) to be observed by confocal microscopy. As in the allosteric conformational spread responses observed in receptor clustering (Bray, D. and Duke, T. (2004) Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 33, 53-73) our tenet is that physical clustering of KcsA channels is behind the observed multiple coupled gating and diverse functional responses.},

abstract = {Mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RyR) have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. However, the precise sequence of events linking RyR channel mutations to a whole heart arrhythmia is not completely understood. In this paper, we apply a detailed, mathematical model of subcellular calcium (Ca) release, coupled to membrane voltage, to study how defective RyR channels can induce arrhythmogenic-triggered activity. In particular, we show that subcellular Ca activity, such as spontaneous Ca sparks and Ca waves, is highly sensitive to coupled gating between RyR channels in clusters. We show that small changes in coupled gating can induce aberrant Ca release activity, which, under Ca overload conditions, can induce delayed afterdepolarization (DAD). We systematically investigate the properties of subcellular Ca during DAD induction and show that the voltage time course during a DAD is dependent on the timing and number of spontaneous Ca sparks that transition to Ca waves. These results provide a detailed mechanism for the role of coupled gating in the genesis of triggered arrhythmias.},

abstract = {Cortical pyramidal cells are constantly bombarded by synaptic activity, much of which arises from other cortical neurons, both in normal conditions and during epileptic seizures. The action potentials generated by barrages of synaptic activity may exhibit a variable site of origin. Here we performed simultaneous whole cell recordings from the soma and axon or soma and apical dendrite of layer 5 pyramidal neurons during normal recurrent network activity (up states), the intrasomatic or intradendritic injection of artificial synaptic barrages, and during epileptiform discharges in vitro. We demonstrate that under all of these conditions, the real or artificial synaptic bombardments propagate through the dendrosomatic-axonal arbor and consistently initiate action potentials in the axon initial segment that then propagate to other parts of the cell. Action potentials recorded intracellularly in vivo during up states and in response to visual stimulation exhibit properties indicating that they are typically initiated in the axon. Intracortical axons were particularly well suited to faithfully follow the generation of action potentials by the axon initial segment. Action-potential generation was more reliable in the distal axon than at the soma during epileptiform activity. These results indicate that the axon is the preferred site of action-potential initiation in cortical pyramidal cells, both in vivo and in vitro, with state-dependent back propagation through the somatic and dendritic compartments.},

abstract = {HCN pacemaker channels (I(f), I(q), or I(h)) play a fundamental role in the physiology of many excitable cell types, including cardiac myocytes and central neurons. While cloned HCN channels have been studied extensively in macroscopic patch clamp experiments, their extremely small conductance has precluded single channel analysis to date. Nevertheless, there remain fundamental questions about HCN gating that can be resolved only at the single channel level. Here we present the first detailed single channel study of cloned mammalian HCN2. Excised patch clamp recordings revealed discrete hyperpolarization-activated, cAMP-sensitive channel openings with amplitudes of 150-230 fA in the activation voltage range. The average conductance of these openings was approximately 1.5 pS at -120 mV in symmetrical 160 mM K(+). Some traces with multiple channels showed unusual gating behavior, characterized by a variable long delay after a voltage step followed by runs of openings. Noise analysis on macroscopic currents revealed fluctuations whose magnitudes were systematically larger than predicted from the actual single channel current size, consistent with cooperativity between single HCN channels.},

Axon dysfunction occupies a central position in many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons. Recent findings suggest that the functional and computational repertoire of the axon is much richer than traditionally thought. Beyond classical axonal propagation, intrinsic voltage-gated ionic currents together with the geometrical properties of the axon determine several complex operations that not only control signal processing in brain circuits but also neuronal timing and synaptic efficacy. Recent evidence for the implication of these forms of axonal computation in the short-term dynamics of neuronal communication is discussed. Finally, we review how neuronal activity regulates both axon morphology and axonal function on a long-term time scale during development and adulthood.},

abstract = {Cardiac ryanodine receptors (RYR2s) infrequently exhibit coupled gating that is manifested by synchronous opening and closing. To better characterize this phenomenon, we investigated the regulation of coupled RYR2 channels by luminal Ca(2+) focusing on effects that are likely mediated by the true luminal activation mechanism. By reconstituting an ion channel into a planar lipid bilayer and using substantially lower concentration of luminal Ba(2+) (8mM, the virtual absence of Ca(2+)) and luminal Ca(2+) (8mM), we show that response of coupled RYR2 channels to caffeine at a diastolic cytosolic Ca(2+) (90nM) was affected by luminal Ca(2+) in a similar manner as for the single RYR2 channel except the gating behavior. Whereas, the single RYR2 channel responded to luminal Ca(2+) by prolongation in open and closed times, coupled RYR2 channels seemed to be resistant in this respect. In summary, we conclude that the class of Ca(2+) sites located on the luminal face of coupled RYR2 channels that is responsible for the channel potentiation by luminal Ca(2+) is functional and not structurally hindered by the channel coupling. Thus, the idea about non-functional luminal Ca(2+) sites as a source of the apparent gating resistance of coupled RYR2 channels to luminal Ca(2+) appears to be ruled out.},

abstract = {Ryanodine receptor-calcium release channels play a pivotal role in the calcium signaling that mediates muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Their membrane organization into regular patterns, functional gating studies and theoretical analysis of receptor clustering have led to models that invoke allosteric interaction between individual channel oligomers as a critical mechanism for control of calcium release. Here we show that in reconstituted "checkerboard-like" lattices that mimic in situ membrane channel arrays, each oligomer is interlocked physically with four adjacent oligomers via a specific domain-domain interaction. Direct physical coupling between ryanodine receptors provides structural evidence for an inter-oligomer allosteric mechanism in channel regulation. Therefore, in addition to established cytosolic and luminal regulation of function, these observations indicate that channel-channel communication through physical coupling provides a novel mode of regulation of intracellular calcium release channels.},

abstract = {Several physiological properties of owl monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells were studied to verify whether its nocturnal habit has an influence on the organization of its subcortical visual system. Receptive field (RF) dimensions were measured using drifting gratings and bipartite field stimuli. We found that owl monkey cells LGN have larger RFs and were on average more non-linear than those of diurnal monkeys. But, as in other anthropoids, there is an increase in RF centre size with increasing eccentricity, and there is a limited correlation between these centre sizes and retinal ganglion cell dendritic tree sizes. The influence of contrast on sizes and peak sensitivities of RF centres and surrounds and on the response phases was studied. Both the sizes and peak sensitivities of the RF centres and surrounds decrease as contrast increases. As a result, the responses to low spatial frequency stimuli saturate with increasing contrast. Estimates of contrasts at half-maximal responses confirm the presence of saturation. It was found that the magnocellular cells saturate more strongly than parvocellular cells. The response phase increases with increasing contrast. These data resemble those obtained in the common marmoset, indicating that these are basic features of the primate visual system. We conclude that during evolution and as an adaptation to a nocturnal lifestyle, cells in the owl monkey LGN display an increased spatial integration in comparison with diurnal primate species, without a change in the basic organization common to the primate subcortical visual system.},

abstract = {Based on recent experimental data, we have developed a conductance-based computational network model of the subthalamic nucleus and the external segment of the globus pallidus in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. Computer simulations and analysis of this model illuminate the roles of the coupling architecture of the network, and associated synaptic conductances, in modulating the activity patterns displayed by this network. Depending on the relationships of these coupling parameters, the network can support three general classes of sustained firing patterns: clustering, propagating waves, and repetitive spiking that may show little regularity or correlation. Each activity pattern can occur continuously or in discrete episodes. We characterize the mechanisms underlying these rhythms, as well as the influence of parameters on details such as spiking frequency and wave speed. These results suggest that the subthalamopallidal circuit is capable both of correlated rhythmic activity and of irregular autonomous patterns of activity that block rhythmicity. Increased striatal input to, and weakened intrapallidal inhibition within, the indirect pathway can switch the behavior of the circuit from irregular to rhythmic. This may be sufficient to explain the emergence of correlated oscillatory activity in the subthalamopallidal circuit after destruction of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease and in animal models of parkinsonism.},

abstract = {Pyramidal cells in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of weakly electric fish have been observed to produce high-frequency burst discharge with constant depolarizing current (Turner et al., 1994). We present a two-compartment model of an ELL pyramidal cell that produces burst discharges similar to those seen in experiments. The burst mechanism involves a slowly changing interaction between the somatic and dendritic action potentials. Burst termination occurs when the trajectory of the system is reinjected in phase space near the "ghost" of a saddle-node bifurcation of fixed points. The burst trajectory reinjection is studied using quasi-static bifurcation theory, that shows a period doubling transition in the fast subsystem as the cause of burst termination. As the applied depolarization is increased, the model exhibits first resting, then tonic firing, and finally chaotic bursting behavior, in contrast with many other burst models. The transition between tonic firing and burst firing is due to a saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles. Analysis of this bifurcation shows that the route to chaos in these neurons is type I intermittency, and we present experimental analysis of ELL pyramidal cell burst trains that support this model prediction. By varying parameters in a way that changes the positions of both saddle-node bifurcations in parameter space, we produce a wide gallery of burst patterns, which span a significant range of burst time scales.},

Our analysis yields existence and stability conditions for clustered states, along with formulas for the periods of such firing patterns. By using two different approaches, we derive complementary conditions, the first set stated in terms of time lengths determined by intrinsic and synaptic properties of the oscillators and their coupling and the second set stated in terms of model parameters and phase space structures directly linked to parameters.

abstract = {Neurons in vivo must process sensory information in the presence of significant noise. It is thus plausible to assume that neural systems have developed mechanisms to reduce this noise. Theoretical studies have shown that threshold fatigue (i.e. cumulative increases in the threshold during repetitive firing) could lead to noise reduction at certain frequencies bands and thus improved signal transmission as well as noise increases and decreased signal transmission at other frequencies: a phenomenon called noise shaping. There is, however, no experimental evidence that threshold fatigue actually occurs and, if so, that it will actually lead to noise shaping. We analyzed action potential threshold variability in intracellular recordings in vivo from pyramidal neurons in weakly electric fish and found experimental evidence for threshold fatigue: an increase in instantaneous firing rate was on average accompanied by an increase in action potential threshold. We show that, with a minor modification, the standard Hodgkin-Huxley model can reproduce this phenomenon. We next compared the performance of models with and without threshold fatigue. Our results show that threshold fatigue will lead to a more regular spike train as well as robustness to intrinsic noise via noise shaping. We finally show that the increased/reduced noise levels due to threshold fatigue correspond to decreased/increased information transmission at different frequencies.},

Using the Fokker-Planck formalism, we show that the equilibrium synaptic distribution induced by such rules is highly sensitive to the manner in which bounds on the allowed range of synaptic values are imposed. In a biologically plausible multiplicative model, the synapses in asynchronous networks reach a distribution that is invariant to the firing rates of either the presynaptic or postsynaptic cells. When these cells are temporally correlated, the synaptic strength varies smoothly with the degree and phase of their synchrony.},

Although a number of biophysical burst mechanisms have been identified, the relationship between burst dynamics and information transfer is uncertain. Electrosensory pyramidal cells have a well defined backpropagation-dependent burst mechanism. We used in vivo, in vitro, and modeling approaches to investigate pyramidal cell responses to mimics of behaviorally relevant sensory input. We found that within a given spike train, bursts are biased toward low-frequency events while isolated spikes simultaneously code for the entire frequency range. We also demonstrated that burst dynamics are essential for optimal feature detection but are not required for stimulus estimation. We conclude that burst and spike dynamics can segregate a single spike train into two parallel and complementary streams of information transfer.},

abstract = {Na+-dependent spikes initiate in the soma or axon hillock region and actively backpropagate into the dendritic arbor of many central neurons. Inward currents underlying spike discharge are offset by outwardK?currents that repolarize a spike and establish a refractory period to temporarily prevent spike discharge. We show in a sensory neuron that somatic and dendritic K+ channels differentially control burst discharge by regulating the extent to which backpropagating dendritic spikes can re-excite the soma. During repetitive discharge a progressive broadening of dendritic spikes promotes a dynamic increase in dendritic spike refractory period. A leaky integrate-and-fire model shows that spike bursts are terminated when a decreasing somatic interspike interval and an increasing den- dritic spike refractory period synergistically act to block backpropagation. The time required for the somatic interspike interval to intersect with dendritic refractory period determines burst frequency, a time that is regulated by somatic and dendritic spike repolarization. Thus, K+ channels involved in spike repolarization can efficiently control the pattern of spike output by establishing a soma- endritic interaction that invokes dynamic shifts in dendritic spike properties.},

abstract = {The estimation and detection of stimuli by sensory neurons is affected by factors that govern a transition from tonic to burst mode and the frequency characteristics of burst output. Pyramidal cells in the electrosensory lobe of weakly electric fish generate spike bursts for the purpose of stimulus detection. Spike bursts are generated during repetitive discharge when a frequency-dependent broadening of dendritic spikes increases current flow from dendrite to soma to potentiate a somatic depolarizing afterpotential (DAP). The DAP eventually triggers a somatic spike doublet with an interspike interval that falls inside the dendritic refractory period, blocking spike backpropagiation and the DAP. Repetition of this process gives rise to a rhythmic dendritic spike failure, termed conditional backpropagation, that converts cell output from tonic to burst discharge. Through in vitro recordings and compartmental modeling we show that burst frequency is regulated by the rate of DAP potentiation during a burst, which determines the time required to discharge the spike doublet that blocks backpropagation. DAP potentiation is magnified through a positive feedback process when an increase in dendritic spike duration activates persistent sodium current (I(NaP)). I(NaP) further promotes a slow depolarization that induces a shift from tonic to burst discharge over time. The results are consistent with a dynamical systems analysis that shows that the threshold separating tonic and burst discharge can be represented as a saddle-node bifurcation. The interaction between dendritic K(+) current and I(NaP) provides a physiological explanation for a variable time scale of bursting dynamics characteristic of such a bifurcation.},

abstract = {Correlations in spike-train ensembles can seriously impair the encoding of information by their spatio-temporal structure. An inevitable source of correlation in finite neural networks is common presynaptic input to pairs of neurons. Recent studies demonstrate that spike correlations in recurrent neural networks are considerably smaller than expected based on the amount of shared presynaptic input. Here, we explain this observation by means of a linear network model and simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that inhibitory feedback efficiently suppresses pairwise correlations and, hence, population-rate fluctuations, thereby assigning inhibitory neurons the new role of active decorrelation. We quantify this decorrelation by comparing the responses of the intact recurrent network (feedback system) and systems where the statistics of the feedback channel is perturbed (feedforward system). Manipulations of the feedback statistics can lead to a significant increase in the power and coherence of the population response. In particular, neglecting correlations within the ensemble of feedback channels or between the external stimulus and the feedback amplifies population-rate fluctuations by orders of magnitude. The fluctuation suppression in homogeneous inhibitory networks is explained by a negative feedback loop in the one-dimensional dynamics of the compound activity. Similarly, a change of coordinates exposes an effective negative feedback loop in the compound dynamics of stable excitatory-inhibitory networks. The suppression of input correlations in finite networks is explained by the population averaged correlations in the linear network model: In purely inhibitory networks, shared-input correlations are canceled by negative spike-train correlations. In excitatory-inhibitory networks, spike-train correlations are typically positive. Here, the suppression of input correlations is not a result of the mere existence of correlations between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, but a consequence of a particular structure of correlations among the three possible pairings (EE, EI, II).},

To correctly interpret these observations it is important to understand the origin of neuronal correlations. Here we study how cells in large recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons interact and how the associated correlations affect stationary states of idle network activity. We demonstrate that the structure of the connectivity matrix of such networks induces considerable correlations between synaptic currents as well as between subthreshold membrane potentials, provided Dale's principle is respected. If, in contrast, synaptic weights are randomly distributed, input correlations can vanish, even for densely connected networks. Although correlations are strongly attenuated when proceeding from membrane potentials to action potentials (spikes), the resulting weak correlations in the spike output can cause substantial fluctuations in the population activity, even in highly diluted networks. We show that simple mean-field models that take the structure of the coupling matrix into account can adequately describe the power spectra of the population activity. The consequences of Dale's principle on correlations and rate fluctuations are discussed in the light of recent experimental findings.},

Popular examples are spike trains from sensory cells where bursts and isolated spikes can serve distinct coding roles. In contrast to analyses of neural coding, the cellular mechanics of burst mechanisms are typically elucidated from the neural response to static input. Bridging the mechanics of bursting with coding of dynamic stimuli is an important step in establishing theories of neural coding. Electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal neurons respond to static inputs with a complex dendrite-dependent burst mechanism. Here we show that in response to dynamic broadband stimuli, these bursts lack some of the electrophysiological characteristics observed in response to static inputs. A simple leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)-style model with a dendrite-dependent depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) is sufficient to match both the output statistics and coding performance of experimental spike trains. We use this model to investigate a simplification of interval coding where the burst interspike interval (ISI) codes for the scale of a canonical upstroke rather than a multidimensional stimulus feature. Using this stimulus reduction, we compute a quantization of the burst ISIs and the upstroke scale to show that the mutual information rate of the interval code is maximized at a moderate DAP amplitude. The combination of a reduced description of ELL pyramidal cell bursting and a simplification of the interval code increases the generality of ELL burst codes to other sensory modalities.},

We derive in particular analytical approximations for cross-spectra, power spectra, and for the coherence function between the postsynaptic input and the time-dependent rate modulation for a specific model. We give simple expressions for the coherence in the limiting cases of pure facilitation and pure depression. Using our analytical results and extensive numerical simulations, we study the spectral coherence function for postsynaptic input resulting from a single synapse or from a group of synapses. For a single synapse, we find that the synaptic coherence function is largely independent of frequency indicating broadband information transmission. This effect is even more pronounced for a large number of synapses. However, additional noise gives rise to frequency-dependent information filtering.},

Many theories of gain control in single cells have used precisely balanced noisy inputs. Such noisy inputs can degrade signal processing. We demonstrate a deterministic method for the control of gain without the use of noise. We show that a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), arising from active dendritic spike backpropagation, leads to a multiplicative increase in gain. Reduction of DAP amplitude by dendritic inhibition dilutes the multiplicative effect, allowing for divisive scaling of the firing rate. In contrast, somatic inhibition acts in a subtractive manner, allowing spatially distinct inhibitory inputs to perform distinct computations. The simplicity of this mechanism and the ubiquity of its elementary components suggest that many cell types have the potential to display a dendritic division of neuronal output.},

Action potentials showed little attenuation in the dendritic tree, which in dopamine neurons was shown to be due to recruitment of dendritic sodium channels and may be related to the dendritic release of dopamine. We conclude that in substantia nigra neurons, the site of action potential initiation, and thus the final site of synaptic integration, is in the axon. As the axon can originate from a dendrite, up to 240 $\mu$m away from the soma, synaptic input to the axon-bearing dendrite may be privileged with respect to its ability to influence action potential initiation.},

abstract = {More than 30 years after Hubel and Wiesel first described orientation selectivity in the mammalian visual cortex, the mechanism that gives rise to this property is still controversial. Hubel and Wiesel proposed a simple model for the origin of orientation tuning, in which the circularly symmetrical receptive fields of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus that excite a cortical simple cell are arranged in rows. Since this model was proposed, several experiments and neuronal simulations have suggested that the connectivity between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the cortex is not well organized in an orientation-specific fashion, and that orientation tuning arises instead from extensive interactions within the cortex. To test these models we have recorded visually evoked synaptic potentials in simple cells while cooling the cortex, which largely inactivates the cortical network, but leaves geniculate synaptic input functional. We report that the orientation tuning of these potentials is almost unaffected by cooling the cortex, in agreement with Hubel and Wiesel's original proposal.},

abstract = {The role of dendrites in neuronal signal processing has been a topic of research for more than a century. Early work started with Cajal's original postulate that dendrites constitute the input side of the neuron and culminated in the idea that dendrites are passive cables. Later studies, however, showed that dendrites could produce action potentials. Here, we review within a historical perspective recent experimental work on the function of mammalian dendrites that has used novel approaches such as imaging of calcium concentration and dendritic patch recording. We do not intend an exhaustive review of the field of dendritic physiology nor cover appropriately progress in invertebrate preparations (Borst and Egelhaaf 1994), but instead focus on a few experimental studies from pyramidal and Purkinje neurons. These new findings have provided direct evidence for active conductances in dendrites and chemical compartmentalization in spines. Although the logic of dendritic processing is still unclear, new results show that mammalian dendrites have a rich repertoire of electrical and chemical dynamics, suggesting that individual neurons are capable of sophisticated information processing. Combining these novel technologies with studies in behaving animals will greatly help in understanding dendritic integration.},

An important component of this transformation is synaptic integration--the combination of voltage deflections produced by a myriad of synaptic inputs into a singular change in membrane potential. There are three basic elements involved in integration: the amplitude of the unitary postsynaptic potential; the manner in which non-simultaneous unitary events add in time (temporal summation), and the addition of unitary events occurring simultaneously in separate regions of the dendritic arbor (spatial summation). This review discusses how passive and active dendritic properties, and the functional characteristics of the synapse, shape these three elements of synaptic integration.},

abstract = {The electrical properties of extracellular space around neurons are important to understand the genesis of extracellular potentials, as well as for localizing neuronal activity from extracellular recordings. However, the exact nature of these extracellular properties is still uncertain. We introduce a method to measure the impedance of the tissue, and which preserves the intact cell-medium interface, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo and in vitro. We find that neural tissue has marked non-ohmic and frequency-filtering properties, which are not consistent with a resistive (ohmic) medium, as often assumed. In contrast, using traditional metal electrodes provides very different results, more consistent with a resistive medium. The amplitude and phase profiles of the measured impedance are consistent with the contribution of ionic diffusion. We also show that the impact of such frequency-filtering properties is possibly important on the genesis of local field potentials, as well as on the cable properties of neurons. The present results show non-ohmic properties of the extracellular medium around neurons, and suggest that source estimation methods, as well as the cable properties of neurons, which all assume ohmic extracellular medium, may need to be re-evaluated.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews recent advances in the understanding of neurochemical transmission and efficient models to incorporate synaptic interactions in neuronal models. After a brief introduction on the different types of ion channels and their gating mechanisms, the first section focuses on the mechanisms of transmitter release by presynaptic terminals. A detailed model of the release process is presented, as well as a simplified representation of the properties of release. The second section reviews detailed models for the most prominent "fast" receptor types in the CNS (AMPA, NMDA, GABA{\_}A) as well as neuromodulators (with GABA{\_}B receptors as a prototype). The next section provides the reader with simplified representations of these currents that are fast to compute while capturing the most salient features of AMPA, NMDA, GABA{\_}A and GABA{\_}B receptor-mediated neurotransmission. For both detailed and simplified models, the kinetic models are compared to experimental data. The last section gives practical implementations of the simplified models, by illustrating the summation of synaptic events for the different types of receptors. An example is also presented for network simulations in which synaptic interactions are represented by kinetic models. Finally, the appendixes gives more formal details on the kinetic representation of gating mechanisms, the procedures used to fit the models to experimental data, and optimized algorithms to implement kinetic synapse models at low computational cost.},

abstract = {1. We examined the spatiotemporal organization of ongoing activity in cat visual areas 17 and 18, in relation to the spontaneous activity of individual neurons. To search for coherent activity, voltage-sensitive dye signals were correlated with the activity of single neurons by the use of spike-triggered averaging. In each recording session an area of at least 2 x 2 mm of cortex was imaged, with 124 diodes. In addition, electrical recordings from two isolated units, the local field potential (LFP) from the same microelectrodes, and the surface electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded simultaneously. 2. The optical signals recorded from the dye were similar to the LFP recorded from the same site. Optical signals recorded from different cortical sites exhibited a different time course. Therefore real-time optical imaging provides information that is equivalent in many ways to multiple-site LFP recordings. 3. The spontaneous firing of single neurons was highly correlated with the optical signals and with the LFP. In 88{\%} of the neurons recorded during spontaneous activity, a significant correlation was found between the occurrence of a spike and the optical signal recorded in a large cortical region surrounding the recording site. This result indicates that spontaneous activity of single neurons is not an independent process but is time locked to the firing or to the synaptic inputs from numerous neurons, all activated in a coherent fashion even without a sensory input. 4. For the cases showing correlation with the optical signal, 27-36{\%} of the optical signal during spike occurrence was directly related to the occurrence of spontaneous spikes in a single neuron, over an area of 2 x 2 mm. In the same cortical area, 43-55{\%} of the activity was directly related to the visual stimulus. 5. Surprisingly, we found that the amplitude of this coherent ongoing activity, recorded optically, was often almost as large as the activity evoked by optimal visual stimulation. The amplitude of the ongoing activity that was directly and reproducibly related to the spontaneous spikes of a single neuron was, on average, as high as 54{\%} of the amplitude of the visually evoked response that was directly related to optimal sensory stimulation, recorded optically. 6. Coherent activity was detected even at distant cortical sites up to 6 mm apart.},

abstract = {A spiking neuron "computes" by transforming a complex dynamical input into a train of action potentials, or spikes. The computation performed by the neuron can be formulated as dimensional reduction, or feature detection, followed by a nonlinear decision function over the low-dimensional space. Generalizations of the reverse correlation technique with white noise input provide a numerical strategy for extracting the relevant low-dimensional features from experimental data, and information theory can be used to evaluate the quality of the low-dimensional approximation. We apply these methods to analyze the simplest biophysically realistic model neuron, the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, using this system to illustrate the general methodological issues. We focus on the features in the stimulus that trigger a spike, explicitly eliminating the effects of interactions between spikes. One can approximate this triggering "feature space" as a two-dimensional linear subspace in the high-dimensional space of input histories, capturing in this way a substantial fraction of the mutual information between inputs and spike time. We find that an even better approximation, however, is to describe the relevant subspace as two dimensional but curved; in this way, we can capture 90{\%} of the mutual information even at high time resolution. Our analysis provides a new understanding of the computational properties of the HH model. While it is common to approximate neural behavior as "integrate and fire," the HH model is not an integrator nor is it well described by a single threshold.},

In lateral pyloric (LP) neurons, we saw strong correlations between measured current and the abundance of Shal and BK-KCa mRNAs (encoding the Shal-family voltage-gated potassium channel and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, respectively). We also saw two- to fourfold interanimal variability for three potassium currents and their mRNA expression. Measurements of channel expression in the two electrically coupled pyloric dilator (PD) neurons showed significant interanimal variability, but copy numbers for IH (encoding the hyperpolarization-activated, inward-current channel) and Shal mRNA in the two PD neurons from the same crab were similar, suggesting that the regulation of some currents may be shared in electrically coupled neurons.},

In Type A neurons, the f-I curves display little sensitivity to input fluctuations when the mean current is large. In contrast, Type B neurons display sensitivity to fluctuations throughout the entire range of input means. Type B- neurons do not fire repetitively for any constant input, whereas Type B+ neurons do. We show that Type B+ behavior results from a separation of time scales between a slow and fast variable. A voltage-dependent time constant for the recovery variable can facilitate sensitivity to input fluctuations. Type B+ firing rates can be approximated using a simple "energy barrier" model.},

Here we consider the receptive field properties of the simple cells in cat V1-the cells that receive direct input from thalamic relay cells-and explore how these properties, many of which are highly nonlinear, arise. We have found that many receptive field properties of V1 simple cells fall directly out of Hubel and Wiesel@s feedforward model when the model incorporates realistic neuronal and synaptic mechanisms, including threshold, synaptic depression, response variability, and the membrane time constant.},

abstract = {Recent experimental and theoretical work indicates that both the intensity and the temporal structure of synaptic activity strongly modulate the integrative properties of single neurons in the intact brain. However, studying these effects experimentally is complicated by the fact that, in experimental systems, network activity is either absent, as in the acute slice preparation, or difficult to monitor and to control, as in in vivo recordings. Here, we present a new implementation of neurotransmitter uncaging in acute brain slices that uses functional projections to generate tightly controlled, spatio-temporally structured synaptic input patterns in individual neurons. For that, a set of presynaptic neurons is activated in a precisely timed sequence through focal photolytic release of caged glutamate with the help of a fast laser scanning system. Integration of synaptic inputs can be studied in postsynaptic neurons that are not directly stimulated with the laser, but receive input from the targeted neurons through intact axonal projections. Our new approach of dynamic photo stimulation employs functional synapses, accounts for their spatial distribution on the dendrites, and thus allows study of the integrative properties of single neurons with physiologically realistic input. Data obtained with our new technique suggest that, not only the neuronal spike generator, but also synaptic transmission and dendritic integration in neocortical pyramidal cells, can be highly reliable.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

abstract = {In many cases, the computation of a neural system can be reduced to a receptive field, or a set of linear filters, and a thresholding function, or gain curve, which determines the firing probability; this is known as a linear/nonlinear model. In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear filters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a randomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated issue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical neurons: the slope of the firing rate versus current (f-I) curve changes with the variance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence between these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the gain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical linear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying system is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with respect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from reverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based model neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple change in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models quantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships. Our results describe how both variance-dependent gain modulation and adaptive neural computation result from intrinsic nonlinearity.},

abstract = {Neurons in sensory cortex integrate multiple influences to parse objects and support perception. Across multiple cortical areas, integration is characterized by two neuronal response properties: (1) surround suppression-modulatory contextual stimuli suppress responses to driving stimuli; and (2) "normalization"-responses to multiple driving stimuli add sublinearly. These depend on input strength: for weak driving stimuli, contextual influences facilitate or more weakly suppress and summation becomes linear or supralinear. Understanding the circuit operations underlying integration is critical to understanding cortical function and disease. We present a simple, general theory. A wealth of integrative properties, including the above, emerge robustly from four cortical circuit properties: (1) supralinear neuronal input/output functions; (2) sufficiently strong recurrent excitation; (3) feedback inhibition; and (4) simple spatial properties of intracortical connections. Integrative properties emerge dynamically as circuit properties, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing similar behaviors. In new recordings in visual cortex, we confirm key model predictions.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons are often classified by current-frequency relationship. Such a static description is inadequate to interpret neuronal responses to time-varying stimuli. Theoretical studies suggested that single-cell dynamical response properties are necessary to interpret ensemble responses to fast input transients. Further, it was shown that input-noise linearizes and boosts the response bandwidth, and that the interplay between the barrage of noisy synaptic currents and the spike-initiation mechanisms determine the dynamical properties of the firing rate. To test these model predictions, we estimated the linear response properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells by injecting a superposition of a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave and a background noise. We characterized the evoked firing probability across many stimulation trials and a range of oscillation frequencies (1-1000 Hz), quantifying response amplitude and phase-shift while changing noise statistics. We found that neurons track unexpectedly fast transients, as their response amplitude has no attenuation up to 200 Hz. This cut-off frequency is higher than the limits set by passive membrane properties (approximately 50 Hz) and average firing rate (approximately 20 Hz) and is not affected by the rate of change of the input. Finally, above 200 Hz, the response amplitude decays as a power-law with an exponent that is independent of voltage fluctuations induced by the background noise.},

abstract = {We investigated the presence and role of local inhibitory cortical control over synchronized thalamic inputs during spindle oscillations (7-14 Hz) by combining intracellular recordings of pyramidal cells in barbiturate-anesthetized cats and computational models. The recordings showed that 1) similar excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)/inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) sequences occurred either during spindles or following thalamic stimulation; 2) reversed IPSPs with chloride-filled pipettes transformed spindle-related EPSP/IPSP sequences into robust bursts with spike inactivation, resembling paroxysmal depolarizing shifts during seizures; and 3) dual simultaneous impalements showed that inhibition associated with synchronized thalamic inputs is local. Computational models were based on reconstructed pyramidal cells constrained by recordings from the same cells. These models showed that the transformation of EPSP/IPSP sequences into fully developed spike bursts critically needs a relatively high density of inhibitory currents in the soma and proximal dendrites. In addition, models predict significant Ca2+ transients in dendrites due to synchronized thalamic inputs. We conclude that synchronized thalamic inputs are subject to strong inhibitory control within the cortex and propose that 1) local impairment of inhibition contributes to the transformation of spindles into spike-wave-type discharges, and 2) spindle-related inputs trigger Ca2+ events in cortical dendrites that may subserve plasticity phenomena during sleep.},

abstract = {To investigate the basis of the fluctuating activity present in neocortical neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique. A simplified 'point-conductance' model was used to represent the currents generated by thousands of stochastically releasing synapses. Synaptic activity was represented by two independent fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances described by stochastic random-walk processes. An advantage of this approach is that all the model parameters can be determined from voltage-clamp experiments. We show that the point-conductance model captures the amplitude and spectral characteristics of the synaptic conductances during background activity. To determine if it can recreate in vivo-like activity, we injected this point-conductance model into a single-compartment model, or in rat prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro using dynamic clamp. This procedure successfully recreated several properties of neurons intracellularly recorded in vivo, such as a depolarized membrane potential, the presence of high-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations, a low-input resistance and irregular spontaneous firing activity. In addition, the point-conductance model could simulate the enhancement of responsiveness due to background activity. We conclude that many of the characteristics of cortical neurons in vivo can be explained by fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances varying stochastically. ?? 2001 IBRO.

The dynamic-clamp (also called conductance injection ) allows experimentalists and theoreticians to challenge neurons (or any other type of cell) with complex conductance stimuli generated by a computer. The technique can be implemented from neural simulation environments and a variety of custom-made or commercial systems. The real-time interaction between the computer and cell also enables the design of recording paradigms with unprecedented accuracy via a computational model of the electrode. Dynamic-Clamp: From Principles to Applications contains contributions from leading researchers in the field, who investigate these paradigms at the cellular or network level, in vivo and in vitro, and in different brain regions and cardiac cells. Topics discussed include the addition of artificially-generated synaptic activity to neurons; adding, amplifying or neutralizing voltage-dependent conductances; creating hybrid networks with real and artificial cells; attaching simulated dendritic tree structures to the living cell; and connecting different neurons. This book will be of interest to experimental biophysicists, neurophysiologists, and cardiac physiologists, as well as theoreticians, engineers, and computational neuroscientists.

However, how a cluster of cells responds to chemoattractants is not fully understood. Neural crest cells are among the most motile cells in the embryo, and their behavior has been likened to malignant invasion. Here, we show that neural crest cells are collectively attracted toward the chemokine Sdf1. While not involved in initially polarizing cells, Sdf1 directionally stabilizes cell protrusions promoted by cell contact. At this cell contact, N-cadherin inhibits protrusion and Rac1 activity and in turn promotes protrusions and activation of Rac1 at the free edge. These results show a role for N-cadherin during contact inhibition of locomotion, and they reveal a mechanism of chemoattraction likely to function during both embryogenesis and cancer metastasis, whereby attractants such as Sdf1 amplify and stabilize contact-dependent cell polarity, resulting in directional collective migration. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Establishing the hippocampal cellular ensemble that represents an animal/'s environment involves the emergence and disappearance of place fields in specific CA1 pyramidal neurons, and the acquisition of different spatial firing properties across the active population. While such firing flexibility and diversity have been linked to spatial memory, attention and task performance, the cellular and network origin of these place cell features is unknown. Basic integrate-and-fire models of place firing propose that such features result solely from varying inputs to place cells, but recent studies suggest instead that place cells themselves may play an active role through regenerative dendritic events. However, owing to the difficulty of performing functional recordings from place cell dendrites, no direct evidence of regenerative dendritic events exists, leaving any possible connection to place coding unknown. Using multi-plane two-photon calcium imaging of CA1 place cell somata, axons and dendrites in mice navigating a virtual environment, here we show that regenerative dendritic events do exist in place cells of behaving mice, and, surprisingly, their prevalence throughout the arbour is highly spatiotemporally variable. Furthermore, we show that the prevalence of such events predicts the spatial precision and persistence or disappearance of place fields. This suggests that the dynamics of spiking throughout the dendritic arbour may play a key role in forming the hippocampal representation of space.},

We show here in mice that connexin 30 controls hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission through modulation of astroglial glutamate transport, which directly alters synaptic glutamate levels. Unexpectedly, we found that connexin 30 regulated cell adhesion and migration and that connexin 30 modulation of glutamate transport, occurring independently of its channel function, was mediated by morphological changes controlling insertion of astroglial processes into synaptic clefts. By setting excitatory synaptic strength, connexin 30 plays an important role in long-term synaptic plasticity and in hippocampus-based contextual memory.

abstract = {The extracellular space has an ambiguous role in neuroscience. It is present in every physiologically relevant system and often used as a measurement site in experimental recordings, but it has received subordinate attention compared to the intracellular domain. In computational modeling, it is often regarded as a passive, homogeneous resistive medium with a constant conductivity, which greatly simplifies the computation of extracellular potentials. However, recent studies have shown that local ionic diffusion and capacitive effects of electrically active membranes can have a substantial impact on the extracellular potential. These effects can not be described by traditional models, and they have been subject to theoretical and experimental analyses. We strive to give an overview over recent progress in modeling the extracellular space with special regard towards the concentration and potential dynamics on different temporal and spatial scales. Three models with distinct assumptions and levels of detail are compared both theoretically and by means of numerical simulations: the classical volume conductor (VC) model, which is most frequently used in form of the line source approximation (LSA); the very detailed, but computationally intensive Poisson-Nernst-Planck model of electrodiffusion (PNP); and an intermediate one called the electroneutral model (EN). The results clearly show that there is no one model for all applications, as they show significantly different responses especially close to neuronal membranes. Finally, we list some common use cases for model simulations and give recommendations on which model to use in each situation.},

abstract = {Dendritic spines are the major loci of synaptic plasticity and are considered as possible structural correlates of memory. Nonetheless, systematic manipulation of specific subsets of spines in the cortex has been unattainable, and thus, the link between spines and memory has been correlational. We developed a novel synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble.},

@article{Maguire1994,
abstract = {The transmitter glutamate is thought to be used by all vertebrate photoreceptors to drive the second-order neurons of the retina, horizontal and bipolar neurons. Dopamine, an endogenous retinal neurotransmitter localized to amacrine and interplexiform cells, has previously been shown to enhance glutamate-gated currents in retinal horizontal cells. In the present study we demonstrate that bipolar cells, like horizontal cells, possess glutamate receptors that are modulated by dopamine. We then identify some components of the pathway through which dopamine acts. We used whole-cell patch recording to measure how bath-applied dopamine modulated the currents elicited by puffs of transmitter solutions at bipolar cell dendrites. Excitatory amino acid-gated currents were evoked by pressure ejecting 1 mM glutamate or 10 microM kainate for 40 msec through a micropipette positioned at the dendrites of bipolar cells. Bath-applied dopamine (20 microM) enhanced the response to glutamate in OFF bipolar cells in the retinal slice by 40{\%} and in isolated OFF bipolar cells by 65{\%}. We also explored the components of the intracellular pathway mediating this modulation. Response enhancement was blocked by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390, but not by the D2 receptor antagonist spiperone, suggesting that the enhancement by dopamine is mediated by a D1 receptor. GDP-beta-S, a G-protein inactivator, blocked the enhancing action of dopamine, suggesting that the D1 receptor activated a G-protein to enhance the glutamate-gated current. Both 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine, a cAMP analog, and the addition of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) to the recording pipette enhanced glutamate-gated currents, while H-7, a PK inactivator, and PKI20amide, a PKA-specific inhibitor, blocked the enhancing action of dopamine. These data suggest that dopamine acts at D1 receptors in the dendrites of bipolar cells to activate adenyl cyclase, which through cAMP enhances a glutamate-gated current in bipolar cell dendrites. Thus, dopamine may modulate synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to OFF bipolar cells.},

abstract = {The pontine nuclei provide the cerebellar hemispheres with the majority of their mossy fiber afferents, and receive their main input from the cerebral cortex. Even though the vast majority of pontine neurons send their axons to the cerebellar cortex, and are contacted monosynaptically by (glutamatergic) corticopontine fibers, the information-processing taking place is not well understood. In addition to typical projection neurons, the pontine nuclei contain putative GABA-ergic interneurons and complex synaptic arrangements. The corticopontine projection is characterized by a precise but highly divergent terminal pattern. Large and functionally diverse parts of the cerebral cortex contribute; in the monkey the most notable exception is the almost total lack of projections from large parts of the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Within corticopontine projections from visual and somatosensory areas there is a de-emphasis of central vision and distal parts of the extremities as compared with other connections of these sensory areas. Subcorticopontine projections provide only a few percent of the total input to the pontine nuclei. Certain cell groups, such as the reticular formation, project in a diffuse manner whereas other nuclei, such as the mammillary nucleus, project to restricted pontine regions only, partially converging with functionally related corticopontine connections. The pontocerebellar projection is characterized by a highly convergent pattern, even though there is also marked divergence. Neurons projecting to a single cerebellar folium appear to be confined to a lamella-shaped volume in the pontine nuclei. The organization of the pontine nuclei suggests that they ensure that information from various, functionally diverse, parts of the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei are brought together and integrated in the cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {The mammalian brain is characterized by orderly spatial distribution of its cellular components, commonly referred to as topographical organization. The topography of cortical and subcortical maps is thought to represent functional or computational properties. In the present investigation, we have studied map transformations and organizing principles in the projections from the cerebral cortex to the pontine nuclei, with emphasis on the mapping of the cortex as a whole onto the pontine nuclei. Following single or multiple axonal tracer injections into different cortical regions, three-dimensional (3-D) distributions of anterogradely labeled axons in the pontine nuclei were mapped. All 3-D reconstructed data sets were normalized to a standardized local coordinate system for the pontine nuclei and uploaded in a database application (FACCS, Functional Anatomy of the Cerebro-Cerebellar System, available via The Rodent Brain Workbench, http://www.rbwb.org). The database application allowed flexible use of the data in novel combinations, and use of a previously published data sets. Visualization of different combinations of data was used to explore alternative principles of organization. As a result of these analyses, a principal map of the topography of corticopontine projections was developed. This map followed the organization of early spatiotemporal gradients present in the cerebral cortex and the pontine nuclei. With the principal map for corticopontine projections, a fairly accurate prediction of pontine target area can be made for any site of origin in the cerebral cortex. The map and the underlying shared data sets represent a basis for modeling of topographical organization and structure-function relationships in this system.},

abstract = {If numbers matter, the projection that connects the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum is probably one of the most-important pathways through the CNS. Its extensive development as one ascends the phylogenetic scale parallels that of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, and it accompanies improvements in motor skills, suggesting that this system might have a decisive role in the generation of skilled movement. This article focuses on the pontine nuclei (PN), which are intercalated in the cerebro- cerebellar pathway, a large nuclear complex in the ventral brainstem of mammals, whose raison d'etre has as yet not been examined. By considering recent morphological and electrophysiological findings, this article argues that the PN are an interface that is needed to accommodate the grossly different computational principles governing the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the projections of the basilar pontine nuclei (BPN) and of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) to the two sides of the cerebellum in the rat. It showed that the two sides of the cerebellar cortex were innervated by different percentages of BPN (about 82{\%} of the cells project to the contralateral cortex and 18{\%} to the ipsilateral) and NRTP cells (some 60{\%} project to the contralateral cortex and 40{\%} to the ipsilateral). In comparison to projections traced to the cortex, only a few fibers were traced to the nuclei of the same animals. Most of the projections of the BPN to the cerebellar nuclei were traced to the lateralis and posterior interpositus nucleus of the contralateral side (95{\%}), while a few were traced to homologous nuclei of the ipsilateral side (5{\%}). Thus, the BPN principally control the activity of the contralateral cerebellum, with a much less important control over the activity of the ipsilateral cerebellum. Vice versa, the NRTP, which project to the lateralis, interpositus, and medialis nuclei of the two sides, with percentages (64{\%} contra- and 36{\%} ipsilateral) similar to those reported for the projections to the cortex, is more concerned in the bilateral control of the cerebellum, although with a moderate contralateral prevalence. The fact that projections of the BPN were principally traced to the contralateral nuclei, from which the efferent projection fibers from the cerebellum originate, suggests that the BPN are principally involved in the motor control of the contralateral body. Conversely, the bilateral projections of the NRTP to the cerebellar nuclei suggest that the NRTP is mainly involved in bilateral motor activities. The comparison of the projections to the cortex and nuclei of the cerebellum of single animals supports the co-existence of coupled (i.e., projections to the cortex and the corresponding nuclei) and uncoupled (i.e., projections to the cortex but not to the nuclei) projection patterns, from both the BPN and the NRTP. These features of the pontocerebellar projections open new vistas on the functional architecture of this pathway. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For instance, neuronal properties affect the degree to which neurons receiving common input will spike synchronously, and whether that synchrony will propagate through the network. Stimulus-evoked synchrony can help or hinder network coding depending on the type of code. In this Perspective, we describe how spike initiation dynamics influence neuronal input-output properties, how those properties affect synchronization, and how synchronization affects network coding. We propose that synchronous and asynchronous spiking can be used to multiplex temporal (synchrony) and rate coding and discuss how pyramidal neurons would be well suited for that task},

Several correlation-based mechanisms are identified, which can effectively switch a neuron on and off. In addition, we investigate the transfer of input correlation to output correlation in pairs of neurons, at the spike train and the membrane potential levels, by considering spike-driving and non-spike-driving inputs separately. In particular, we propose a plausible explanation for the in vivo finding that membrane potentials in neighboring neurons are correlated, but the spike-triggered averages of membrane potentials preceding a spike are not: Neighboring neurons possibly receive an ongoing bombardment of correlated subthreshold background inputs, and occasionally uncorrelated spike-driving inputs.},

abstract = {Isolated feedforward networks (FFNs) of spiking neurons have been studied extensively for their ability to propagate transient synchrony and asynchronous firing rates, in the presence of activity independent synaptic background noise (Diesmann et al., 1999; van Rossum et al., 2002). In a biologically realistic scenario, however, the FFN should be embedded in a recurrent network, such that the activity in the FFN and the network activity may dynamically interact. Previously, transient synchrony propagating in an FFN was found to destabilize the dynamics of the embedding network (Mehring et al., 2003). Here, we show that by modeling synapses as conductance transients, rather than current sources, it is possible to embed and propagate transient synchrony in the FFN, without destabilizing the background network dynamics. However, the network activity has a strong impact on the type of activity that can be propagated in the embedded FFN. Global synchrony and high firing rates in the embedding network prohibit the propagation of both, synchronous and asynchronous spiking activity. In contrast, asynchronous low-rate network states support the propagation of both, synchronous spiking and asynchronous, but only low firing rates. In either case, spiking activity tends to synchronize as it propagates, challenging the feasibility to transmit information in asynchronous firing rates. Finally, asynchronous network activity allows to embed more than one FFN, with the amount of cross talk depending on the degree of overlap in the FFNs. This opens the possibility of computational mechanisms using transient synchrony among the activities in multiple FFNs.},

Surprisingly, the conditions under which spiking activity can be propagated have received comparatively little attention in the experimental literature. By contrast, several computational studies in the last decade have addressed this issue. Using feedforward networks (FFNs) as a generic network model, they have identified two dynamical activity modes that support the propagation of either asynchronous (rate code) or synchronous (temporal code) spiking. Here, we review the dichotomy of asynchronous and synchronous propagation in FFNs, propose their integration into a single extended conceptual framework and suggest experimental strategies to test our hypothesis.},

@article{Renart2007,
abstract = {Spike trains from cortical neurons show a high degree of irregularity, with coefficients of variation (CV) of their interspike interval (ISI) distribution close to or higher than one. It has been suggested that this irregularity might be a reflection of a particular dynamical state of the local cortical circuit in which excitation and inhibition balance each other. In this "balanced" state, the mean current to the neurons is below threshold, and firing is driven by current fluctuations, resulting in irregular Poisson-like spike trains. Recent data show that the degree of irregularity in neuronal spike trains recorded during the delay period of working memory experiments is the same for both low-activity states of a few Hz and for elevated, persistent activity states of a few tens of Hz. Since the difference between these persistent activity states cannot be due to external factors coming from sensory inputs, this suggests that the underlying network dynamics might support coexisting balanced states at different firing rates. We use mean field techniques to study the possible existence of multiple balanced steady states in recurrent networks of current-based leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. To assess the degree of balance of a steady state, we extend existing mean-field theories so that not only the firing rate, but also the coefficient of variation of the interspike interval distribution of the neurons, are determined self-consistently. Depending on the connectivity parameters of the network, we find bistable solutions of different types. If the local recurrent connectivity is mainly excitatory, the two stable steady states differ mainly in the mean current to the neurons. In this case, the mean drive in the elevated persistent activity state is suprathreshold and typically characterized by low spiking irregularity. If the local recurrent excitatory and inhibitory drives are both large and nearly balanced, or even dominated by inhibition, two stable states coexist, both with subthreshold current drive. In this case, the spiking variability in both the resting state and the mnemonic persistent state is large, but the balance condition implies parameter fine-tuning. Since the degree of required fine-tuning increases with network size and, on the other hand, the size of the fluctuations in the afferent current to the cells increases for small networks, overall we find that fluctuation-driven persistent activity in the very simplified type of models we analyze is not a robust phenomenon. Possible implications of considering more realistic models are discussed.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) serve a wide range of physiological functions and their activity is modulated by different neurotransmitter systems. GABAergic inhibition of VDCCs in neurons has an important impact in controlling transmitter release, neuronal plasticity, gene expression and neuronal excitability. We investigated the molecular signalling mechanisms by which GABA(B) receptors inhibit calcium-mediated electrogenesis (Ca(2+) spikes) in the distal apical dendrite of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Ca(2+) spikes are the basis of coincidence detection and signal amplification of distal tuft synaptic inputs characteristic for the computational function of cortical pyramidal neurons. By combining dendritic whole-cell recordings with two-photon fluorescence Ca(2+) imaging we found that all subtypes of VDCCs were present in the Ca(2+) spike initiation zone, but that they contribute differently to the initiation and sustaining of dendritic Ca(2+) spikes. Particularly, Ca(v)1 VDCCs are the most abundant VDCC present in this dendritic compartment and they generated the sustained plateau potential characteristic for the Ca(2+) spike. Activation of GABA(B) receptors specifically inhibited Ca(v)1 channels. This inhibition of L-type Ca(2+) currents was transiently relieved by strong depolarization but did not depend on protein kinase activity. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel membrane-delimited interaction of the G(i/o)-$\beta$$\gamma$-subunit with Ca(v)1 channels identifying this mechanism as the general pathway of GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition of VDCCs. Furthermore, the characterization of the contribution of the different VDCCs to the generation of the Ca(2+) spike provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of dendritic computation.},

The long-lasting form of this inhibition is believed to operate via $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptors, but the process is poorly understood at the cellular level. We found that the firing of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rat somatosensory cortex due to contralateral sensory stimulation was inhibited for hundreds of milliseconds when paired with ipsilateral stimulation. The inhibition acted directly on apical dendrites via layer 1 interneurons but was silent in the absence of pyramidal cell firing, relying on metabotropic inhibition of active dendritic currents recruited during neuronal activity. The results not only reveal the microcircuitry underlying interhemispheric inhibition but also demonstrate the importance of active dendritic properties for cortical output.},

abstract = {The computational power of single neurons is greatly enhanced by active dendritic conductances that have a large influence on their spike activity. In cortical output neurons such as the large pyramidal cells of layer 5 (L5), activation of apical dendritic calcium channels leads to plateau potentials that increase the gain of the input/output function and switch the cell to burst-firing mode. The apical dendrites are innervated by local excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as thalamic and corticocortical projections, which makes it a formidable task to predict how these inputs influence active dendritic properties in vivo. Here we investigate activity in populations of L5 pyramidal dendrites of the somatosensory cortex in awake and anaesthetized rats following sensory stimulation using a new fibre-optic method for recording dendritic calcium changes. We show that the strength of sensory stimulation is encoded in the combined dendritic calcium response of a local population of L5 pyramidal cells in a graded manner. The slope of the stimulus-response function was under the control of a particular subset of inhibitory neurons activated by synaptic inputs predominantly in L5. Recordings from single apical tuft dendrites in vitro showed that activity in L5 pyramidal neurons disynaptically coupled via interneurons directly blocks the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes in neighbouring pyramidal neurons. The results constitute a functional description of a cortical microcircuit in awake animals that relies on the active properties of L5 pyramidal dendrites and their very high sensitivity to inhibition. The microcircuit is organized so that local populations of apical dendrites can adaptively encode bottom-up sensory stimuli linearly across their full dynamic range.},

Dendrites are endowed with mechanisms of nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs leading to regenerative dendritic events including local sodium, NMDA and calcium spikes. The generation of these events requires distinct spatio-temporal activation patterns of synaptic inputs. We hypothesise that the recent findings on dendritic spikes and local synaptic plasticity rules suggest clustering of common inputs along a subregion of a dendritic branch. These clusters may enable dendrites to separately threshold groups of functionally similar inputs, thus allowing single neurons to act as a superposition of many separate integrate and fire units.

We now have a wealth of information about the active dendritic properties of cortical neurons including axonally generated sodium action potentials as well as local sodium spikelets generated in the dendrites, calcium plateau spikes, and NMDA spikes. All of these events have been shown to be highly modified by the spatiotemporal pattern of nearby inhibitory input which can drastically change the output firing mode of the neuron. This means that particular populations of interneurons embedded in the neocortical microcircuitry can more precisely control pyramidal cell output than has previously been thought. Furthermore, the output of any given neuron tends to feed back onto inhibitory circuits making the resultant network activity further dependent on inhibition. Network activity is therefore ultimately governed by the subcellular microcircuitry of the cortex and it is impossible to ignore the subcompartmentalization of inhibitory influence at the neuronal level in order to understand its effects at the network level. In this article, we summarize the inhibitory circuits that have been shown so far to act on specific dendritic compartments in vivo.},

Computational and in vitro studies have proposed cellular mechanisms of gain modulation based on the postsynaptic effects of background synaptic activation, but these mechanisms have not been studied in vivo. Here, we used intracellular recordings from cat primary visual cortex to measure neuronal gain while changing background synaptic activity with visual stimulation. We found that increases in the membrane fluctuations associated with increases in synaptic input do not obligatorily result in gain modulation in vivo. However, visual stimuli that evoked sustained changes in resting membrane potential, input resistance, and membrane fluctuations robustly modulated neuronal gain. The magnitude of gain modulation depended critically on the spatiotemporal properties of the visual stimulus. Gain modulation in vivo may thus be determined on a moment-to-moment basis by sensory context and the consequent dynamics of synaptic activation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we identify cellular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of cortical neurons to the timing of sensory-evoked synaptic inputs. We find that temporally coincident inputs to layer 4 neurons in primary visual cortex evoke an increase in spike precision and supralinear spike summation. Underlying this nonlinear summation are changes in the evoked excitatory conductance and the associated membrane potential response, and a lengthening of the window between excitation and inhibition. Furthermore, fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons in layer 4 exhibit a shorter window of temporal sensitivity compared with excitatory neurons. In contrast to the enhanced response to synchronous inputs by layer 4 neurons, sensory input integration in downstream cortical layers is more linear and less sensitive to timing. Neurons in the input layer of cortex are thus uniquely optimized to detect and encode synchronous sensory-evoked inputs.},

Administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists alters gamma rhythms, and can induce cognitive as well as psychosis-like symptoms in humans. The disruption of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling specifically in FS PV interneurons is therefore hypothesized to give rise to neural network dysfunction that could underlie these symptoms. To address the connection between NMDAR activity, FS PV interneurons, gamma oscillations and behavior, we generated mice lacking NMDAR neurotransmission only in PV cells (PV-Cre/NR1f/f mice). Here, we show that mutant mice exhibit enhanced baseline cortical gamma rhythms, impaired gamma rhythm induction after optogenetic drive of PV interneurons and reduced sensitivity to the effects of NMDAR antagonists on gamma oscillations and stereotypies. Mutant mice show largely normal behaviors except for selective cognitive impairments, including deficits in habituation, working memory and associative learning. Our results provide evidence for the critical role of NMDAR in PV interneurons for expression of normal gamma rhythms and specific cognitive behaviors.},

abstract = {Reliable representation of the spectrotemporal features of an acoustic stimulus is critical for sound recognition. However, if all neurons respond with identical firing to the same stimulus, redundancy in the activity patterns would reduce the information capacity of the population. We thus investigated spike reliability and temporal fluctuation coding in an ensemble of neurons recorded in vitro from the avian auditory brain stem. Sequential patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons of the cochlear nucleus angularis (NA) while injecting identical filtered Gaussian white noise currents, simulating synaptic drive. The spiking activity in neurons receiving these identically fluctuating stimuli was highly correlated, measured pairwise across neurons and as a population. Two distinct uncorrelated noise stimuli could be discriminated using the temporal patterning, but not firing rate, of the spike trains in the neural ensemble, with best discrimination using information at time scales of 5-20 ms. Despite high cross-correlation values, the spike patterns observed in individual neurons were ideosyncratic, with notable heterogeneity across neurons. To investigate how temporal information is being encoded, we used optimal linear reconstruction to produce an estimate of the original current stimulus from the spike trains. Ensembles of trains sampled across the neural population could be used to predict {\textgreater}50{\%} of the stimulus variation using optimal linear decoding, compared to {\~{}}20{\%} using the same number of spike trains recorded from single neurons. We conclude that heterogeneity in the intrinsic biophysical properties of cochlear nucleus neurons reduces firing pattern redundancy while enhancing representation of temporal information.},

Previous work has focused on the ability of background synaptic noise to modulate the slope (i.e., gain) of the frequency-current (f-I) relationship in neurons. To date, demonstrations of gain control that are independent of synaptic noise have been limited. We investigated the effects of increasing somatic conductance in the form of tonic inhibition on the initial and steady-state f-I relationship of CA1 pyramidal cells. We find that increasing membrane conductance reduces the gain of the steady-state f-I relationship through a graded increase in the magnitude of spike frequency adaptation. Increased adaptation arises through a conductance-induced depolarization of spike voltage threshold. Thus, by increasing the magnitude of spike frequency adaptation, added conductance can reduce the gain of the steady-state f-I relationship in the absence of random background membrane fluctuations.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals are arranged in columns, and the neurons in each column respond best to light-dark borders of particular orientations. The basis of cortical cell orientation selectivity is not known. One possible mechanism would be for cortical cells to receive input from several lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons with receptive fields that are aligned in the visual field (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). We have investigated the relationship between the arrangement of the receptive fields of geniculocortical afferents and the orientation preferences of cortical cells in the orientation columns to which the afferents provide visual input. Radial microelectrode penetrations were made into primary visual cortex of anesthetized adult sable ferrets. Cortical cells were recorded throughout the depth of the cortex, and their orientation preferences were determined. Cortical cell responses were then eliminated by superfusion of the cortex with either kainic acid (Zahs and Stryker, 1988) or muscimol. After the drug treatment, responses from many single units with distinct receptive fields were recorded. These responses were presumed to be those of geniculocortical afferents, because they had the response properties characteristic of LGN neurons, and because they could be recorded only in cortical layers that receive geniculate input. In 16 of 18 cases, the afferent receptive fields recorded in a single penetration covered an elongated region of visual space. In these penetrations, the best-fit line through the centers of the afferent receptive fields generally paralleled the preferred orientation of cortical cells recorded at the same site in cortex. These results are consistent with the Hubel and Wiesel (1962) model for the construction of oriented visual cortical receptive fields from geniculate inputs with aligned receptive fields.},

abstract = {Adaptation occurs in a variety of forms in all sensory systems, motivating the question: what is its purpose? A productive approach has been to hypothesize that adaptation helps neural systems to efficiently encode stimuli whose statistics vary in time. To encode efficiently, a neural system must change its coding strategy, or computation, as the distribution of stimuli changes. Information theoretic methods allow this efficient coding hypothesis to be tested quantitatively. Empirically, adaptive processes occur over a wide range of timescales. On short timescales, underlying mechanisms include the contribution of intrinsic nonlinearities. Over longer timescales, adaptation is often power-law-like, implying the coexistence of multiple timescales in a single adaptive process. Models demonstrate that this can result from mechanisms within a single neuron.},

abstract = {Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in awake cat and monkey show a depolarized state, sustained firing, and intense subthreshold synaptic activity. It is not known what conductance dynamics underlie such activity and how neurons process information in such highly stochastic states. Here, we combine intracellular recordings in awake and naturally sleeping cats with computational models to investigate subthreshold dynamics of conductances and how conductance dynamics determine spiking activity. We show that during both wakefulness and the "up-states" of natural slow-wave sleep, membrane-potential activity stems from a diversity of combinations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances, with dominant inhibition in most of the cases. Inhibition also provides the largest contribution to membrane potential fluctuations. Computational models predict that in such inhibition-dominant states, spikes are preferentially evoked by a drop of inhibitory conductance, and that its signature is a transient drop of membrane conductance before the spike. This pattern of conductance change is indeed observed in estimates of spike-triggered averages of synaptic conductances during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep up states. These results show that activated states are defined by diverse combinations of excitatory and inhibitory conductances with pronounced inhibition, and that the dynamics of inhibition is particularly effective on spiking, suggesting an important role for inhibitory processes in both conscious and unconscious cortical states.},

abstract = {Adaptive processes over many timescales endow neurons with sensitivity to stimulus changes over a similarly wide range of scales. Although spike timing of single neurons can precisely signal rapid fluctuations in their inputs, the mean firing rate can convey information about slower-varying properties of the stimulus. Here, we investigate the firing rate response to a slowly varying envelope of whisker motion in two processing stages of the rat vibrissa pathway. The whiskers of anesthetized rats were moved through a noise trajectory with an amplitude that was sinusoidally modulated at one of several frequencies. In thalamic neurons, we found that the rate response to the stimulus envelope was also sinusoidal, with an approximately frequency-independent phase advance with respect to the input. Responses in cortex were similar but with a phase shift that was about three times larger, consistent with a larger amount of rate adaptation. These response properties can be described as a linear transformation of the input for which a single parameter quantifies the phase shift as well as the degree of adaptation. These results are reproduced by a model of adapting neurons connected by synapses with short-term plasticity, showing that the observed linear response and phase lead can be built up from a network that includes a sequence of nonlinear adapting elements. Our study elucidates how slowly varying envelope information under passive stimulation is preserved and transformed through the vibrissa processing pathway.},

Similar slow events also occur spontaneously, can still be observed when neuronal activity and synaptic glutamate release are blocked, and are found to be mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes acting preferentially on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. The slow currents can be triggered by stimuli that evoke Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes, including photolysis of caged Ca2+ in single astrocytes. As revealed by paired recording and Ca2+ imaging, a striking feature of this NMDA receptor response is that it occurs synchronously in multiple CA1 neurons. Our results reveal a distinct mechanism for neuronal excitation and synchrony and highlight a functional link between astrocytic glutamate and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.},

abstract = {Glutamate uptake into nerve and glial cells usually functions to keep the extracellular glutamate concentration low in the central nervous system. But one component of glutamate release from neurons is calcium-independent, suggesting a non-vesicular release that may be due to a reversal of glutamate uptake. The activity of the electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier can be monitored by measuring the membrane current it produces, and uptake is activated by intracellular potassium ions. Here we report that raising the potassium concentration around glial cells evokes an outward current component produced by reversed glutamate uptake. This current is activated by intracellular glutamate and sodium, inhibited by extracellular glutamate and sodium, and increased by membrane depolarization. These results demonstrate a non-vesicular mechanism for the release of glutamate from glial cells and neurons. This mechanism may contribute to the neurotoxic rise in extracellular glutamate concentration during brain anoxia.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter released from neurons is known to signal to neighbouring neurons and glia. Here we demonstrate an additional signalling pathway in which glutamate is released from astrocytes and causes an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated increase in neuronal calcium. Internal calcium was elevated and glutamate release stimulated by application of the neuroligand bradykinin to cultured astrocytes. Elevation of astrocyte internal calcium was also sufficient to induce glutamate release. To determine whether this released glutamate signals to neurons, we studied astrocyte-neuron co-cultures. Bradykinin significantly increased calcium levels in neurons co-cultured with astrocytes, but not in solitary neurons. The glutamate receptor antagonists D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid and D-glutamylglycine prevented bradykinin-induced neuronal calcium elevation. When single astrocytes were directly stimulated to increase internal calcium and release glutamate, calcium levels of adjacent neurons were increased; this increase could be blocked by D-glutamylglycine. Thus, astrocytes regulate neuronal calcium levels through the calcium-dependent release of glutamate.},

Since one outcome of SNARE-dependent gliotransmission is the regulation of extracellular adenosine and because adenosine promotes sleep, we genetically inhibited the release of gliotransmitters and asked if astrocytes play an unsuspected role in sleep regulation. Inhibiting gliotransmission attenuated the accumulation of sleep pressure, assessed by measuring the slow wave activity of the EEG during NREM sleep, and prevented cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. Since the sleep-suppressing effects of the A1 receptor antagonist CPT were prevented following inhibition of gliotransmission and because intracerebroventricular delivery of CPT to wild-type mice mimicked the transgenic phenotype, we conclude that astrocytes modulate the accumulation of sleep pressure and its cognitive consequences through a pathway involving A1 receptors.},

abstract = {In the mammalian brain, astrocytes modulate neuronal function, in part, by synchronizing neuronal firing and coordinating synaptic networks. Little, however, is known about how this is accomplished from a structural standpoint. To investigate the structural basis of astrocyte-mediated neuronal synchrony and synaptic coordination, the three-dimensional relationships between cortical astrocytes and neurons was investigated. Using a transgenic and viral approach to label astrocytes with enhanced green fluorescent protein, we performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of astrocytes from tissue sections or live animals in vivo. We found that cortical astrocytes occupy nonoverlapping territories similar to those described in the hippocampus. Using immunofluorescence labeling of neuronal somata, a single astrocyte enwraps on average four neuronal somata with an upper limit of eight. Single-neuron dye-fills allowed us to estimate that one astrocyte contacts 300-600 neuronal dendrites. Together with the recent findings showing that glial Ca2+ signaling is restricted to individual astrocytes in vivo, and that Ca2+ signaling leads to gliotransmission, we propose the concept of functional islands of synapses in which groups of synapses confined within the boundaries of an individual astrocyte are modulated by the gliotransmitter environment controlled by that astrocyte. Our description offers a new structurally based conceptual framework to evaluate functional data involving interactions between neurons and astrocytes in the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that glutamate transporter-mediated currents occur in astrocytes when glutamate is released from hippocampal synapses. These transporters remove excess glutamate from the extracellular space, thereby facilitating synaptic input specificity and preventing neurotoxicity. Little is known about the position of astrocytic processes at hippocampal synapses. Serial electron microscopy and three-dimensional analyses were used to investigate structural relationships between astrocytes and synapses in stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1 in the mature rat in vivo and in slices. Only 57 {\{}+/-{\}} 11{\%} of the synapses had astrocytic processes apposed to them. Of these, the astrocytic processes surrounded less than half (0.43 {\{}+/-{\}} 22) of the synaptic interface. Other studies suggest that astrocytes extend processes toward higher concentrations of glutamate; thus the presence of astrocytic processes at particular hippocampal synapses might signal which ones are releasing glutamate. The distance between nearest neighboring synapses was usually ({\~{}}95{\%}) {\textless}1 {\{}micro{\}}m. Astrocytic processes occurred along the extracellular path between 33{\%} of the neighboring synapses, neuronal processes occurred along the path between another 66{\%} of the neighboring synapses, and only 1{\%} of the synapses were close enough such that neither astrocytic nor neuronal processes occurred between them. These morphological arrangements suggest that the glutamate released at approximately two-thirds of hippocampal synapses might diffuse to other synapses, unless neuronal glutamate transporters are more effective than previously reported. The findings also suggest that physiological recordings made from hippocampal astrocytes do not uniformly sample the glutamate released from all hippocampal synapses.},

abstract = {Slow oscillatory activity ({\textless}1 Hz) is observed in vivo in the cortex during slow-wave sleep or under anesthesia and in vitro when the bath solution is chosen to more closely mimic cerebrospinal fluid. Here we present a biophysical network model for the slow oscillations observed in vitro that reproduces the single neuron behaviors and collective network firing patterns in control as well as under pharmacological manipulations. The membrane potential of a neuron oscillates slowly (at {\textless}1 Hz) between a down state and an up state; the up state is maintained by strong recurrent excitation balanced by inhibition, and the transition to the down state is due to a slow adaptation current (Na(+)-dependent K(+) current). Consistent with in vivo data, the input resistance of a model neuron, on average, is the largest at the end of the down state and the smallest during the initial phase of the up state. An activity wave is initiated by spontaneous spike discharges in a minority of neurons, and propagates across the network at a speed of 3-8 mm/s in control and 20-50 mm/s with inhibition block. Our work suggests that long-range excitatory patchy connections contribute significantly to this wave propagation. Finally, we show with this model that various known physiological effects of neuromodulation can switch the network to tonic firing, thus simulating a transition to the waking state.},

Whether this process affects neuronal network activity in vivo is not known. Using a combination of astrocyte-specific molecular genetics, with in vivo electrophysiology and pharmacology, we determined that gliotransmission modulates cortical slow oscillations, a rhythm characterizing nonrapid eye movement sleep. Inhibition of gliotransmission by the expression of a dominant negative SNARE domain in astrocytes affected cortical slow oscillations, reducing the duration of neuronal depolarizations and causing prolonged hyperpolarizations. These network effects result from the astrocytic modulation of intracortical synaptic transmission at two sites: a hypofunction of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, and by reducing extracellular adenosine, a loss of tonic A1 receptor-mediated inhibition. These results demonstrate that rhythmic brain activity is generated by the coordinated action of the neuronal and glial networks.},

abstract = {The balance between excitation and inhibition is critical in the physiology of the cerebral cortex. To understand the influence of inhibitory control on the emergent activity of the cortical network, inhibition was progressively blocked in a slice preparation that generates spontaneous rhythmic up states at a similar frequency to those occurring in vivo during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. Progressive removal of inhibition induced a parametric shortening of up state duration and elongation of the down states, the frequency of oscillations decaying. Concurrently, a gradual increase in the network firing rate during up states occurred. The slope of transitions between up and down states was quantified for different levels of inhibition. The slope of upward transitions reflects the recruitment of the local network and was progressively increased when inhibition was decreased, whereas the speed of activity propagation became faster. Removal of inhibition eventually resulted in epileptiform activity. Whereas gradual reduction of inhibition induced linear changes in up/down states and their propagation, epileptiform activity was the result of a nonlinear transformation. A computational network model showed that strong recurrence plus activity-dependent hyperpolarizing currents were sufficient to account for the observed up state modulations and predicted an increase in activity-dependent hyperpolarization following up states when inhibition was decreased, which was confirmed experimentally.},

abstract = {In the local cortical network, spontaneous emergent activity self-organizes in rhythmic patterns. These rhythms include a slow one ({\textless}1 Hz), consisting in alternation of up and down states, and also faster rhythms (10-80 Hz) generated during up states. Varying the temperature in the bath between 26 and 41 degrees C resulted in a strong modulation of the emergent network activity. Up states became shorter for warmer temperatures and longer with cooling, whereas down states were shortest at physiological (36-37 degrees C) temperature. The firing rate during up states was robustly modulated by temperature, increasing with higher temperatures. The sparse firing rate during down states hardly varied with temperature, thus resulting in a progressive merging of up and down states for temperatures around 30 degrees C. Below 30 degrees C and down to 26 degrees C the firing lost rhythmicity, becoming progressively continuous. The slope of the down-to-up transitions, which reflects the speed of recruitment of the local network, was progressively steeper for higher temperatures, whereas wave-propagation speed exhibited only a moderate increase. Fast rhythms were particularly sensitive to temperature. Broadband high-frequency fluctuations in the local field potential were maximal for recordings at 36-38 degrees C. Overall, we found that maintaining cortical slices at physiological temperature is critical for the generated activity to be analogous to that in vivo. We also demonstrate that changes in activity with temperature were not secondary to oxygenation changes. Temperature variation sets the in vitro cortical network at different functional regimes, allowing the exploration of network activity generation and control mechanisms.},

abstract = {Neuronal dendrites are electrically excitable: they can generate regenerative events such as dendritic spikes in response to sufficiently strong synaptic input. Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.},

abstract = {We discuss potential caveats when estimating topologies of 3D brain networks from surface recordings. It is virtually impossible to record activity from all single neurons in the brain and one has to rely on techniques that measure average activity at sparsely located (non-invasive) recording sites. Effects of this spatial sampling in relation to structural network measures like centrality and assortativity were analyzed using multivariate classifiers. A simplified model of 3D brain connectivity incorporating both short- and long-range connections served for testing. To mimic M/EEG recordings we sampled this model via non-overlapping regions and weighted nodes and connections according to their proximity to the recording sites. We used various complex network models for reference and tried to classify sampled versions of the "brain-like" network as one of these archetypes. It was found that sampled networks may substantially deviate in topology from the respective original networks for small sample sizes. For experimental studies this may imply that surface recordings can yield network structures that might not agree with its generating 3D network. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is the only technique that allows to directly measure neuronal activity over a large cortical population. It thus gives access to the dynamics of lateral interactions within or between cortical areas. However, VSDI signal suffers from a weak signal-to-noise ratio and processing methods are either rudimentary or dedicated to spatial or temporal denoising alone. Here we present an innovative method inspired by fMRI data processing, where the goal is to allow, for the first time, denoising of spatio-temporally inseparable VSDI signals and in the most challenging experimental condition, i.e. single trials in awake behaving monkeys. The method is based on a linear model (LM) decomposition of individual VSDI trials. The LM was designed meticulously by identifying all noise and signal components that are known to affect VSDI. We then compared its output against the classical methods based on blank division and detrending. LM proved to be significantly much more efficient to denoise spatial maps and temporal dynamics compared to these usual techniques. It also largely reduced trial-to-trial variability. These performances resulted in a four-fold improvement of signal-to-noise ratio and a two-fold increase of response detectability. Hence, with this method, fewer trials were needed to reach a high signal-to-noise ratio. Lastly, we showed that the LM method can accommodate for a large range of response dynamics, a crucial property for estimating spatial spread of activity or contrast dynamics. We believe that this method will make a strong contribution to imaging dynamics of population responses with high spatial and temporal resolution in trial-based experiments of awake animals. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Spike trains from sensory cortex neurons can predict trial-to-trial variability in choice. Choice-related spiking is widely studied as a way to link cortical activity to perception, but its origins remain unclear. Using imaging and electrophysiology, we found that mouse primary somatosensory cortex neurons showed robust choice-related activity during a tactile detection task. Spike trains from primary mechanoreceptive neurons did not predict choices about identical stimuli. Spike trains from thalamic relay neurons showed highly transient, weak choice-related activity. Intracellular recordings in cortex revealed a prolonged choice-related depolarization in most neurons that was not accounted for by feed-forward thalamic input. Top-down axons projecting from secondary to primary somatosensory cortex signaled choice. An intracellular measure of stimulus sensitivity determined which neurons converted choice-related depolarization into spiking. Our results reveal how choice-related spiking emerges across neural circuits and within single neurons.},

Here, we obtain whole-cell membrane potential recordings from the dorsolateral striatum of mice trained to lick a reward spout after a whisker deflection. Striatal projection neurons showed strong task-related modulation, with more depolarization and action potential firing on hit trials compared to misses. Direct pathway striatonigral neurons, but not indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, exhibited a prominent early sensory response. Optogenetic stimulation of direct pathway striatonigral neurons, but not indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, readily substituted for whisker stimulation evoking a licking response. Our data are consistent with direct pathway striatonigral neurons contributing a “go” signal for goal-directed sensorimotor transformation leading to action initiation.

abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

abstract = {Background: Synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neocortical neurons are important for mammalian sensory perception. Synaptic transmission between identified neurons within neocortical microcircuits has mainly been studied in brain slice preparations in vitro. Here, we investigate brain-state-dependent neocortical synaptic interactions in vivo by combining the specificity of optogenetic stimulation with the precision of whole-cell recordings from postsynaptic excitatory glutamatergic neurons and GFP-labeled inhibitory GABAergic neurons targeted through two-photon microscopy. Results: Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons evoked larger and faster depolarizing postsynaptic potentials and more synaptically driven action potentials in fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons compared to both non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons and postsynaptic excitatory pyramidal neurons located within the same neocortical microcircuit. The number of action potentials evoked in ChR2-expressing neurons showed low trial-to-trial variability, but postsynaptic responses varied strongly with near-linear dependence upon spontaneously driven changes in prestimulus membrane potential. Postsynaptic responses in excitatory neurons had reversal potentials, which were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold and were therefore inhibitory. Reversal potentials measured in postsynaptic GABAergic neurons were close to action potential threshold. Postsynaptic inhibitory neurons preferentially fired synaptically driven action potentials from spontaneously depolarized network states, with stronger state-dependent modulation in NFS GABAergic neurons compared to FS GABAergic neurons. Conclusions: Inhibitory neurons appear to dominate neocortical microcircuit function, receiving stronger local excitatory synaptic input and firing more action potentials compared to excitatory neurons. In mouse layer 2/3 barrel cortex, we propose that strong state-dependent recruitment of inhibitory neurons drives competition among excitatory neurons enforcing sparse coding. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Broadly tuned, dense subthreshold synaptic input accompanied by sparse action potential (AP) firing in excitatory neurons provides a simple and reliable neural code useful for associative learning. Sparse AP firing is enforced by strong inhibition from genetically defined classes of GABAergic neurons.

Through multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings, we quantify connectivity maps between individual excitatory neurons located across all cortical layers of the C2 barrel column. Synaptic connectivity depended strongly upon somatic laminar location of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, providing definitive evidence for layer-specific signaling pathways. The strongest excitatory influence upon the cortical column was provided by presynaptic layer 4 neurons.

Sensory responses evoked by passive whisker stimulation lasted longer and spread further across the barrel cortex in awake mice compared to anesthetized mice. Passively evoked sensory responses were large during behaviorally quiet periods and small during active whisking. However, as an exploring mouse approached an object while whisking, large-amplitude, propagating cortical sensory activity was evoked by active whisker-touch.

abstract = {Computations in cortical circuits are mediated by synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and yet we know little about their activity in awake animals. Here, through single and dual whole-cell recordings combined with two-photon microscopy in the barrel cortex of behaving mice, we directly compare the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory layer 2/3 neurons. We find that inhibitory neurons depolarize synchronously with excitatory neurons, but they are much more active with differential contributions of two classes of inhibitory neurons during different brain states. Fast-spiking GABAergic neurons dominate during quiet wakefulness, but??during active wakefulness Non-fast-spiking GABAergic neurons depolarize, firing action potentials at increased rates. Sparse uncorrelated action potential firing in excitatory neurons is driven by fast, large, and cell-specific depolarization. In contrast, inhibitory neurons fire correlated action potentials at much higher frequencies driven by slower, smaller, and broadly synchronized depolarization.

abstract = {Internal brain states affect sensory perception, cognition, and learning. Many neocortical areas exhibit changes in the pattern and synchrony of neuronal activity during quiet versus active behaviors. Active behaviors are typically associated with desynchronized cortical dynamics. Increased thalamic firing contributes importantly to desynchronize mouse barrel cortex during active whisker sensing. However, a whisking-related cortical state change persists after thalamic inactivation, which is mediated at least in part by acetylcholine, as we show here by using whole-cell recordings, local pharmacology, axonal calcium imaging, and optogenetic stimulation. During whisking, we find prominent cholinergic signals in the barrel cortex, which suppress spontaneous cortical activity. The desynchronized state of barrel cortex during whisking is therefore driven by at least two distinct signals with opposing functions: increased thalamic activity driving glutamatergic excitation of the cortex and increased cholinergic input suppressing spontaneous cortical activity. Eggermann etal. now find that the desynchronized state of the barrel cortex during active whisker sensing is accompanied by increased cholinergic input, which suppresses slow spontaneous cortical activity in excitatory layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons.},

abstract = {The primary somatosensory barrel cortex processes tactile vibrissae information, allowing rodents to actively perceive spatial and textural features of their immediate surroundings. Each whisker on the snout is individually represented in the neocortex by an anatomically identifiable 'barrel' specified by the segregated termination zones of thalamocortical axons of the ventroposterior medial nucleus, which provide the primary sensory input to the neocortex. The sensory information is subsequently processed within local synaptically connected neocortical microcircuits, which have begun to be investigated in quantitative detail. In addition to these local synaptic microcircuits, the excitatory pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex send and receive long-range glutamatergic axonal projections to and from a wide variety of specific brain regions. Much less is known about these long-range connections and their contribution to sensory processing. Here, we review current knowledge of the long-range axonal input and output of the mouse primary somatosensory barrel cortex. Prominent reciprocal projections are found between primary somatosensory cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex, motor cortex, perirhinal cortex and thalamus. Primary somatosensory barrel cortex also projects strongly to striatum, thalamic reticular nucleus, zona incerta, anterior pretectal nucleus, superior colliculus, pons, red nucleus and spinal trigeminal brain stem nuclei. These long-range connections of the barrel cortex with other specific cortical and subcortical brain regions are likely to play a crucial role in sensorimotor integration, sensory perception and associative learning.},

abstract = {Synaptic interactions between nearby excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the neocortex are thought to play fundamental roles in sensory processing. Here, we have combined optogenetic stimulation, whole cell recordings, and computational modeling to define key functional microcircuits within layer 2/3 of mouse primary somatosensory barrel cortex. In vitro optogenetic stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 evoked a rapid sequence of excitation followed by inhibition. Fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons received large-amplitude, fast-rising depolarizing postsynaptic potentials, often driving action potentials. In contrast, the same optogenetic stimulus evoked small-amplitude, subthreshold postsynaptic potentials in excitatory and non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons. To understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying this network activity, we investigated unitary synaptic connectivity through multiple simultaneous whole cell recordings. FS GABAergic neurons received unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials with higher probability, larger amplitudes, and faster kinetics compared with NFS GABAergic neurons and other excitatory neurons. Both FS and NFS GABAergic neurons evoked robust inhibition on postsynaptic layer 2/3 neurons. A simple computational model based on the experimentally determined electrophysiological properties of the different classes of layer 2/3 neurons and their unitary synaptic connectivity accounted for key aspects of the network activity evoked by optogenetic stimulation, including the strong recruitment of FS GABAergic neurons acting to suppress firing of excitatory neurons. We conclude that FS GABAergic neurons play an important role in neocortical microcircuit function through their strong local synaptic connectivity, which might contribute to driving sparse coding in excitatory layer 2/3 neurons of mouse barrel cortex in vivo.},

abstract = {Primary sensory cortex discriminates incoming sensory information and generates multiple processing streams toward other cortical areas. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, by making whole-cell recordings in primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) of behaving mice, we show that S1 neurons projecting to primary motor cortex (M1) and those projecting to secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) have distinct intrinsic membrane properties and exhibit markedly different membrane potential dynamics during behavior. Passive tactile stimulation evoked faster and larger postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in M1-projecting neurons, rapidly driving phasic action potential firing, well-suited for stimulus detection. Repetitive active touch evoked strongly depressing PSPs and only transient firing in M1-projecting neurons. In contrast, PSP summation allowed S2-projecting neurons to robustly signal sensory information accumulated during repetitive touch, useful for encoding object features. Thus, target-specific transformation of sensory-evoked synaptic potentials by S1 projection neurons generates functionally distinct output signals for sensorimotor coordination and sensory perception. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The sensory responses in the barrel cortex of mice aged postnatal day (P)7-P12 evoked by a single whisker deflection are smaller in amplitude and spread over a smaller area than those measured in P13-P21 mice. However, repetitive 10-Hz stimulation or paired pulse whisker stimulation in P7-P12 mice evoked facilitating sensory responses, contrasting with the depressing sensory responses observed in P13-P21 mice. This facilitation occurred during an interval ranging 300-1,000 ms after the first stimulus and was measured using whole cell recordings, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and calcium-sensitive dye imaging. The facilitated responses were not only larger in amplitude but also propagated over a larger cortical area. The facilitation could be blocked by local application of pharmacological agents reducing cortical excitability. Local cortical microstimulation could substitute for the first whisker stimulus to produce a facilitated sensory response. The enhanced sensory responses evoked by repetitive sensory stimuli in P7-P12 mice may contribute to the activity-dependent specification of the developing cortical circuits. In addition, the facilitating sensory responses allow long integration times for sensory processing compatible with the slow behavior of mice during early postnatal development.},

Ultimately, the structural consolidation of competing sensory inputs is mediated by a proteolytic reorganization of the extracellular matrix that occurs only during the critical period.

abstract = {1. The post-natal development of the electrophysiological properties of cortical layer V pyramidal neurons was investigated with intracellular recordings from rat sensorimotor cortical slices, in vitro. 2. At all ages post-natally (post-natal day 1 to day 36; P1-P36) neurons were capable of generating a train of Na+-dependent action potentials in response to intracellular injection of sufficient depolarizing current. During the second and third week post-natally, these action potentials changed substantially, becoming faster in both their rising and falling phases, shorter in duration, and larger in amplitude. 3. Both mature (greater than P21) and immature (P2-P4) cortical neurones could generate Ca2+-dependent action potentials only if a substantial portion of K+ conductances were blocked. The maximum rate of rise of Ca2+ spikes also increased with age. 4. The apparent input resistance, specific membrane resistance, and membrane time constant all decreased with age from P1 to P30. Immature neurones had I-V relationships that were substantially more linear than those of adult cells, although rectification was often present in both the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing range. Inward rectification in the depolarizing range was Na+ dependent and was substantially larger in mature versus immature neurones. 5. Single, or trains of, action potentials in immature neurones were followed by short duration (10-50 ms) and long duration (1-5 s) after-hyperpolarizations (a.h.p.s) respectively. The duration of the latter appeared to decrease with age. The presence of large a.h.p.s indicates that Ca2+ entry occurs during the action potential of immature, as well as mature, neurones. 6. Responses to intracellular injection of depolarizing current pulses indicated that immature neurones have frequency versus injected current (f-I) relationships which are in general less steep than those for adult neurones and more limited in terms of the range of firing frequencies. 7. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a considerable increase in the density of voltage-dependent ionic channels underlying the electro-responsiveness of cortical pyramidal neurones during post-natal development.},

We present a simplified working-model biophysical scheme of pyramidal neurons that attempts to capture the essence of their dendritic function, including the ability to behave under plausible conditions as dynamic computational subunits. We emphasize the electrogenic capabilities of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) because these transmitter-gated channels seem to provide the major nonlinear depolarizing drive in thin dendrites, even allowing full-blown NMDA spikes. We show how apparent discrepancies in experimental findings can be reconciled and discuss the current status of dendritic spikes in vivo; a dominant NMDAR contribution would indicate that the input-output relations of thin dendrites are dynamically set by network activity and cannot be fully predicted by purely reductionist approaches.},

Computational and in vitro studies have proposed cellular mechanisms of gain modulation based on the postsynaptic effects of background synaptic activation, but these mechanisms have not been studied in vivo. Here, we used intracellular recordings from cat primary visual cortex to measure neuronal gain while changing background synaptic activity with visual stimulation. We found that increases in the membrane fluctuations associated with increases in synaptic input do not obligatorily result in gain modulation in vivo. However, visual stimuli that evoked sustained changes in resting membrane potential, input resistance, and membrane fluctuations robustly modulated neuronal gain. The magnitude of gain modulation depended critically on the spatiotemporal properties of the visual stimulus. Gain modulation in vivo may thus be determined on a moment-to-moment basis by sensory context and the consequent dynamics of synaptic activation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Correlated spiking has been widely observed, but its impact on neural coding remains controversial. Correlation arising from comodulation of rates across neurons has been shown to vary with the firing rates of individual neurons. This translates into rate and correlation being equivalently tuned to the stimulus; under those conditions, correlated spiking does not provide information beyond that already available from individual neuron firing rates. Such correlations are irrelevant and can reduce coding efficiency by introducing redundancy. Using simulations and experiments in rat hippocampal neurons, we show here that pairs of neurons receiving correlated input also exhibit correlations arising from precise spike-time synchronization. Contrary to rate comodulation, spike-time synchronization is unaffected by firing rate, thus enabling synchrony- and rate-based coding to operate independently. The type of output correlation depends on whether intrinsic neuron properties promote integration or coincidence detection: "ideal" integrators (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus mean) exhibit rate comodulation, whereas ideal coincidence detectors (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus variance) exhibit precise spike-time synchronization. Pyramidal neurons are sensitive to both stimulus mean and variance, and thus exhibit both types of output correlation proportioned according to which operating mode is dominant. Our results explain how different types of correlations arise based on how individual neurons generate spikes, and why spike-time synchronization and rate comodulation can encode different stimulus properties. Our results also highlight the importance of neuronal properties for population-level coding insofar as neural networks can employ different coding schemes depending on the dominant operating mode of their constituent neurons.},

abstract = {During sensory stimulation, visual cortical neurons undergo massive synaptic bombardment. This increases their input conductance, and action potentials mainly result from membrane potential fluctuations. To understand the response properties of neurons operating in this regime, we studied a model neuron with synaptic inputs represented by transient membrane conductance changes. We show that with a simultaneous increase of excitation and inhibition, the firing rate first increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at higher input rates. Comodulation of excitation and inhibition, therefore, does not provide a straightforward way of controlling the neuronal firing rate, in contrast to coding mechanisms postulated previously. The synaptically induced conductance increase plays a key role in this effect: it decreases firing rate by shunting membrane potential fluctuations, and increases it by reducing the membrane time constant, allowing for faster membrane potential transients. These findings do not depend on details of the model and, hence, are relevant to cells of other cortical areas as well.},

abstract = {In the intact brain neurons are constantly exposed to intense synaptic activity. This heavy barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was recreated in vitro by injecting a noisy current, generated as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, into the soma of rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The response to such in vivo-like currents was studied systematically by analyzing the time development of the instantaneous spike frequency, and when possible, the stationary mean spike frequency as a function of both the mean and the variance of the input current. All cells responded with an in vivo-like action potential activity with stationary statistics that could be sustained throughout long stimulation intervals (tens of seconds), provided the frequencies were not too high. The temporal evolution of the response revealed the presence of mechanisms of fast and slow spike frequency adaptation, and a medium duration mechanism of facilitation. For strong input currents, the slow adaptation mechanism made the spike frequency response nonstationary. The minimal frequencies that caused strong slow adaptation (a decrease in the spike rate by more than 1 Hz/s), were in the range 30-80 Hz and depended on the pipette solution used. The stationary response function has been fitted by two simple models of integrate-and-fire neurons endowed with a frequency-dependent modification of the input current. This accounts for all the fast and slow mechanisms of adaptation and facilitation that determine the stationary response, and proved necessary to fit the model to the experimental data. The coefficient of variability of the interspike interval was also in part captured by the model neurons, by tuning the parameters of the model to match the mean spike frequencies only. We conclude that the integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency-dependent adaptation/facilitation is an adequate model reduction of cortical cells when the mean spike-frequency response to in vivo-like currents with stationary statistics is considered.},

abstract = {The study of several aspects of the collective dynamics of interacting neurons can be highly simplified if one assumes that the statistics of the synaptic input is the same for a large population of similarly behaving neurons (mean field approach). In particular, under such an assumption, it is possible to determine and study all the equilibrium points of the network dynamics when the neuronal response to noisy, in vivo-like, synaptic currents is known. The response function can be computed analytically for simple integrate-and-fire neuron models and it can be measured directly in experiments in vitro. Here we review theoretical and experimental results about the neural response to noisy inputs with stationary statistics. These response functions are important to characterize the collective neural dynamics that are proposed to be the neural substrate of working memory, decision making and other cognitive functions. Applications to the case of time-varying inputs are reviewed in a companion paper (Giugliano et al. in Biol Cybern, 2008). We conclude that modified integrate-and-fire neuron models are good enough to reproduce faithfully many of the relevant dynamical aspects of the neuronal response measured in experiments on real neurons in vitro.},

abstract = {Neurons spike when their membrane potential exceeds a threshold value. In central neurons, the spike threshold is not constant but depends on the stimulation. Thus, input-output properties of neurons depend both on the effect of presynaptic spikes on the membrane potential and on the dynamics of the spike threshold. Among the possible mechanisms that may modulate the threshold, one strong candidate is Na channel inactivation, because it specifically impacts spike initiation without affecting the membrane potential. We collected voltage-clamp data from the literature and we found, based on a theoretical criterion, that the properties of Na inactivation could indeed cause substantial threshold variability by itself. By analyzing simple neuron models with fast Na inactivation (one channel subtype), we found that the spike threshold is correlated with the mean membrane potential and negatively correlated with the preceding depolarization slope, consistent with experiments. We then analyzed the impact of threshold dynamics on synaptic integration. The difference between the postsynaptic potential (PSP) and the dynamic threshold in response to a presynaptic spike defines an effective PSP. When the neuron is sufficiently depolarized, this effective PSP is briefer than the PSP. This mechanism regulates the temporal window of synaptic integration in an adaptive way. Finally, we discuss the role of other potential mechanisms. Distal spike initiation, channel noise and Na activation dynamics cannot account for the observed negative slope-threshold relationship, while adaptive conductances (e.g. K+) and Na inactivation can. We conclude that Na inactivation is a metabolically efficient mechanism to control the temporal resolution of synaptic integration.},

abstract = {Gain modulation is an important feature of neural activity. Previous work has focused on the ability of background synaptic noise to modulate the slope (i.e., gain) of the frequency-current (f-I) relationship in neurons. To date, demonstrations of gain control that are independent of synaptic noise have been limited. We investigated the effects of increasing somatic conductance in the form of tonic inhibition on the initial and steady-state f-I relationship of CA1 pyramidal cells. We find that increasing membrane conductance reduces the gain of the steady-state f-I relationship through a graded increase in the magnitude of spike frequency adaptation. Increased adaptation arises through a conductance-induced depolarization of spike voltage threshold. Thus, by increasing the magnitude of spike frequency adaptation, added conductance can reduce the gain of the steady-state f-I relationship in the absence of random background membrane fluctuations.},

abstract = {Reliable representation of the spectrotemporal features of an acoustic stimulus is critical for sound recognition. However, if all neurons respond with identical firing to the same stimulus, redundancy in the activity patterns would reduce the information capacity of the population. We thus investigated spike reliability and temporal fluctuation coding in an ensemble of neurons recorded in vitro from the avian auditory brain stem. Sequential patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons of the cochlear nucleus angularis (NA) while injecting identical filtered Gaussian white noise currents, simulating synaptic drive. The spiking activity in neurons receiving these identically fluctuating stimuli was highly correlated, measured pairwise across neurons and as a population. Two distinct uncorrelated noise stimuli could be discriminated using the temporal patterning, but not firing rate, of the spike trains in the neural ensemble, with best discrimination using information at time scales of 5-20 ms. Despite high cross-correlation values, the spike patterns observed in individual neurons were ideosyncratic, with notable heterogeneity across neurons. To investigate how temporal information is being encoded, we used optimal linear reconstruction to produce an estimate of the original current stimulus from the spike trains. Ensembles of trains sampled across the neural population could be used to predict {\textgreater}50{\%} of the stimulus variation using optimal linear decoding, compared to {\~{}}20{\%} using the same number of spike trains recorded from single neurons. We conclude that heterogeneity in the intrinsic biophysical properties of cochlear nucleus neurons reduces firing pattern redundancy while enhancing representation of temporal information.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons are often classified by current-frequency relationship. Such a static description is inadequate to interpret neuronal responses to time-varying stimuli. Theoretical studies suggested that single-cell dynamical response properties are necessary to interpret ensemble responses to fast input transients. Further, it was shown that input-noise linearizes and boosts the response bandwidth, and that the interplay between the barrage of noisy synaptic currents and the spike-initiation mechanisms determine the dynamical properties of the firing rate. To test these model predictions, we estimated the linear response properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells by injecting a superposition of a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave and a background noise. We characterized the evoked firing probability across many stimulation trials and a range of oscillation frequencies (1-1000 Hz), quantifying response amplitude and phase-shift while changing noise statistics. We found that neurons track unexpectedly fast transients, as their response amplitude has no attenuation up to 200 Hz. This cut-off frequency is higher than the limits set by passive membrane properties (approximately 50 Hz) and average firing rate (approximately 20 Hz) and is not affected by the rate of change of the input. Finally, above 200 Hz, the response amplitude decays as a power-law with an exponent that is independent of voltage fluctuations induced by the background noise.},

abstract = {The modulation of the sensitivity, or gain, of neural responses to input is an important component of neural computation. It has been shown that divisive gain modulation of neural responses can result from a stochastic shunting from balanced (mixed excitation and inhibition) background activity. This gain control scheme was developed and explored with static inputs, where the membrane and spike train statistics were stationary in time. However, input statistics, such as the firing rates of pre-synaptic neurons, are often dynamic, varying on timescales comparable to typical membrane time constants. Using a population density approach for integrate-and-fire neurons with dynamic and temporally rich inputs, we find that the same fluctuation-induced divisive gain modulation is operative for dynamic inputs driving nonequilibrium responses. Moreover, the degree of divisive scaling of the dynamic response is quantitatively the same as the steady-state responses--thus, gain modulation via balanced conductance fluctuations generalizes in a straight-forward way to a dynamic setting.},

abstract = {In many cases, the computation of a neural system can be reduced to a receptive field, or a set of linear filters, and a thresholding function, or gain curve, which determines the firing probability; this is known as a linear/nonlinear model. In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear filters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a randomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated issue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical neurons: the slope of the firing rate versus current (f-I) curve changes with the variance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence between these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the gain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical linear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying system is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with respect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from reverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based model neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple change in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models quantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships. Our results describe how both variance-dependent gain modulation and adaptive neural computation result from intrinsic nonlinearity.},

Previous gain control mechanisms have suggested that voltage fluctuations play a key role in determining neuronal gain in vivo. Here we show that, under increased membrane conductance, voltage fluctuations restore Na(+) current and reduce spike frequency adaptation in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. As a consequence, membrane voltage fluctuations produce a leftward shift in the frequency-current relationship without a change in gain, relative to an increase in conductance alone. Furthermore, we show that these changes have important implications for the integration of inhibitory inputs. Due to the ability to restore Na(+) current, hyperpolarizing membrane voltage fluctuations mediated by GABA(A)-like inputs can increase firing rate in a high-conductance state. Finally, our data show that the effects on gain and synaptic integration are mediated by voltage fluctuations within a physiologically relevant range of frequencies (10-40 Hz).},

abstract = {Correlated spiking has been widely observed, but its impact on neural coding remains controversial. Correlation arising from comodulation of rates across neurons has been shown to vary with the firing rates of individual neurons. This translates into rate and correlation being equivalently tuned to the stimulus; under those conditions, correlated spiking does not provide information beyond that already available from individual neuron firing rates. Such correlations are irrelevant and can reduce coding efficiency by introducing redundancy. Using simulations and experiments in rat hippocampal neurons, we show here that pairs of neurons receiving correlated input also exhibit correlations arising from precise spike-time synchronization. Contrary to rate comodulation, spike-time synchronization is unaffected by firing rate, thus enabling synchrony- and rate-based coding to operate independently. The type of output correlation depends on whether intrinsic neuron properties promote integration or coincidence detection: "ideal" integrators (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus mean) exhibit rate comodulation, whereas ideal coincidence detectors (with spike generation sensitive to stimulus variance) exhibit precise spike-time synchronization. Pyramidal neurons are sensitive to both stimulus mean and variance, and thus exhibit both types of output correlation proportioned according to which operating mode is dominant. Our results explain how different types of correlations arise based on how individual neurons generate spikes, and why spike-time synchronization and rate comodulation can encode different stimulus properties. Our results also highlight the importance of neuronal properties for population-level coding insofar as neural networks can employ different coding schemes depending on the dominant operating mode of their constituent neurons.},

At the single neuron level, gain modulation can arise if the two inputs are subject to a direct multiplicative interaction. Alternatively, these inputs can be summed in a linear manner by the neuron and gain modulation can arise, instead, from a nonlinear input-output relationship. We derive a mathematical constraint that can distinguish these two mechanisms even though they can look very similar, provided sufficient data of the appropriate type are available. Previously, it has been shown in coordinate transformation studies that artificial neurons with sigmoid transfer functions can acquire a nonlinear additive form of gain modulation through learning-driven adjustment of synaptic weights. We use the constraint derived for single-neuron studies to compare responses in this network with those of another network model based on a biologically inspired transfer function that can support approximately multiplicative interactions.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons are often classified by current-frequency relationship. Such a static description is inadequate to interpret neuronal responses to time-varying stimuli. Theoretical studies suggested that single-cell dynamical response properties are necessary to interpret ensemble responses to fast input transients. Further, it was shown that input-noise linearizes and boosts the response bandwidth, and that the interplay between the barrage of noisy synaptic currents and the spike-initiation mechanisms determine the dynamical properties of the firing rate. To test these model predictions, we estimated the linear response properties of layer 5 pyramidal cells by injecting a superposition of a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave and a background noise. We characterized the evoked firing probability across many stimulation trials and a range of oscillation frequencies (1-1000 Hz), quantifying response amplitude and phase-shift while changing noise statistics. We found that neurons track unexpectedly fast transients, as their response amplitude has no attenuation up to 200 Hz. This cut-off frequency is higher than the limits set by passive membrane properties (approximately 50 Hz) and average firing rate (approximately 20 Hz) and is not affected by the rate of change of the input. Finally, above 200 Hz, the response amplitude decays as a power-law with an exponent that is independent of voltage fluctuations induced by the background noise.},

abstract = {Directional collective migration is now a widely recognized mode of migration during embryogenesis and cancer. However, how a cluster of cells responds to chemoattractants is not fully understood. Neural crest cells are among the most motile cells in the embryo, and their behavior has been likened to malignant invasion. Here, we show that neural crest cells are collectively attracted toward the chemokine Sdf1. While not involved in initially polarizing cells, Sdf1 directionally stabilizes cell protrusions promoted by cell contact. At this cell contact, N-cadherin inhibits protrusion and Rac1 activity and in turn promotes protrusions and activation of Rac1 at the free edge. These results show a role for N-cadherin during contact inhibition of locomotion, and they reveal a mechanism of chemoattraction likely to function during both embryogenesis and cancer metastasis, whereby attractants such as Sdf1 amplify and stabilize contact-dependent cell polarity, resulting in directional collective migration. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the projections of the basilar pontine nuclei (BPN) and of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) to the two sides of the cerebellum in the rat. It showed that the two sides of the cerebellar cortex were innervated by different percentages of BPN (about 82{\%} of the cells project to the contralateral cortex and 18{\%} to the ipsilateral) and NRTP cells (some 60{\%} project to the contralateral cortex and 40{\%} to the ipsilateral). In comparison to projections traced to the cortex, only a few fibers were traced to the nuclei of the same animals. Most of the projections of the BPN to the cerebellar nuclei were traced to the lateralis and posterior interpositus nucleus of the contralateral side (95{\%}), while a few were traced to homologous nuclei of the ipsilateral side (5{\%}). Thus, the BPN principally control the activity of the contralateral cerebellum, with a much less important control over the activity of the ipsilateral cerebellum. Vice versa, the NRTP, which project to the lateralis, interpositus, and medialis nuclei of the two sides, with percentages (64{\%} contra- and 36{\%} ipsilateral) similar to those reported for the projections to the cortex, is more concerned in the bilateral control of the cerebellum, although with a moderate contralateral prevalence. The fact that projections of the BPN were principally traced to the contralateral nuclei, from which the efferent projection fibers from the cerebellum originate, suggests that the BPN are principally involved in the motor control of the contralateral body. Conversely, the bilateral projections of the NRTP to the cerebellar nuclei suggest that the NRTP is mainly involved in bilateral motor activities. The comparison of the projections to the cortex and nuclei of the cerebellum of single animals supports the co-existence of coupled (i.e., projections to the cortex and the corresponding nuclei) and uncoupled (i.e., projections to the cortex but not to the nuclei) projection patterns, from both the BPN and the NRTP. These features of the pontocerebellar projections open new vistas on the functional architecture of this pathway. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Brodal1992,
abstract = {The pontine nuclei provide the cerebellar hemispheres with the majority of their mossy fiber afferents, and receive their main input from the cerebral cortex. Even though the vast majority of pontine neurons send their axons to the cerebellar cortex, and are contacted monosynaptically by (glutamatergic) corticopontine fibers, the information-processing taking place is not well understood. In addition to typical projection neurons, the pontine nuclei contain putative GABA-ergic interneurons and complex synaptic arrangements. The corticopontine projection is characterized by a precise but highly divergent terminal pattern. Large and functionally diverse parts of the cerebral cortex contribute; in the monkey the most notable exception is the almost total lack of projections from large parts of the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Within corticopontine projections from visual and somatosensory areas there is a de-emphasis of central vision and distal parts of the extremities as compared with other connections of these sensory areas. Subcorticopontine projections provide only a few percent of the total input to the pontine nuclei. Certain cell groups, such as the reticular formation, project in a diffuse manner whereas other nuclei, such as the mammillary nucleus, project to restricted pontine regions only, partially converging with functionally related corticopontine connections. The pontocerebellar projection is characterized by a highly convergent pattern, even though there is also marked divergence. Neurons projecting to a single cerebellar folium appear to be confined to a lamella-shaped volume in the pontine nuclei. The organization of the pontine nuclei suggests that they ensure that information from various, functionally diverse, parts of the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei are brought together and integrated in the cerebellar cortex.},

abstract = {If numbers matter, the projection that connects the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum is probably one of the most-important pathways through the CNS. Its extensive development as one ascends the phylogenetic scale parallels that of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, and it accompanies improvements in motor skills, suggesting that this system might have a decisive role in the generation of skilled movement. This article focuses on the pontine nuclei (PN), which are intercalated in the cerebro- cerebellar pathway, a large nuclear complex in the ventral brainstem of mammals, whose raison d'etre has as yet not been examined. By considering recent morphological and electrophysiological findings, this article argues that the PN are an interface that is needed to accommodate the grossly different computational principles governing the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum.},

@article{Leergaard2007,
abstract = {The mammalian brain is characterized by orderly spatial distribution of its cellular components, commonly referred to as topographical organization. The topography of cortical and subcortical maps is thought to represent functional or computational properties. In the present investigation, we have studied map transformations and organizing principles in the projections from the cerebral cortex to the pontine nuclei, with emphasis on the mapping of the cortex as a whole onto the pontine nuclei. Following single or multiple axonal tracer injections into different cortical regions, three-dimensional (3-D) distributions of anterogradely labeled axons in the pontine nuclei were mapped. All 3-D reconstructed data sets were normalized to a standardized local coordinate system for the pontine nuclei and uploaded in a database application (FACCS, Functional Anatomy of the Cerebro-Cerebellar System, available via The Rodent Brain Workbench, http://www.rbwb.org). The database application allowed flexible use of the data in novel combinations, and use of a previously published data sets. Visualization of different combinations of data was used to explore alternative principles of organization. As a result of these analyses, a principal map of the topography of corticopontine projections was developed. This map followed the organization of early spatiotemporal gradients present in the cerebral cortex and the pontine nuclei. With the principal map for corticopontine projections, a fairly accurate prediction of pontine target area can be made for any site of origin in the cerebral cortex. The map and the underlying shared data sets represent a basis for modeling of topographical organization and structure-function relationships in this system.},
